<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>These two lectures were given quite independently,
the former to the Students’ Association at Edinburgh
on December 22nd, 1885, and the latter as
a public lecture in the University of Oxford on
Washington’s birthday, February 22nd, 1886. As
they were written for two different audiences, and as
one leading idea ran through both, there was naturally
a good deal of repetition, sometimes even to the
very words. This I have, in revising them for the
press, done my best to get rid of. They appear now
as two discourses, looking at the same general subject
from two somewhat different points of view, and
each putting different points more prominently forward.
To these I have added, as an Appendix, such
parts as were not immediately temporary of an
article which appeared in Macmillan’s Magazine for
April, 1885, under the heading of “Imperial Federation.”
In this article, written only to be read and
not to be heard, some points which were treated
in a more rhetorical way in the lectures are dealt
with in a style of more minute argument. It seemed
therefore to make a fitting commentary on the
lectures.</p>

<h2 id="GREECE">GREATER GREECE AND GREATER BRITAIN.</h2>

<p>The name of Greater Britain is one which of
late years has become strangely familiar. It is
possible that a generation back the words might
have fallen harshly on patriotic ears. We were
then used to believe that the Britain in which
we lived was so great that there could be none
greater. The name of “Great Britain” was perhaps
used without any very clear notion of its
history; but it was at least accepted as implying
greatness of some kind. Whatever may have been
the exact meaning with which the name of “Greater
Britain” was first brought in, it was, we may be
sure, suggested by the seemingly older phrase of
“Great Britain.” Those who first spoke of “Greater
Britain” perhaps hardly knew that the name is
as old as that of “Great Britain,” and, more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
this, that “Great Britain” and “Greater Britain”
are in truth phrases of exactly the same meaning.
I would not venture to say how much older the
name of “Magna Britannia” may be than its
somewhat irregular employment in the royal style
by James Sixth and First. But “Greater Britain,”
“Major Britannia,” is undoubtedly as old as the
twelfth century. We perhaps sometimes forget
that, besides this our isle of Britain, there is
another Britain on the continent, no other than
the land which, by a slight change of ending, we
commonly call Britanny. But in Latin and in
French the two names are the same, <i>Britannia</i>
and <i>Bretagne</i>. The one land is <i>Bretagne</i>, the
other is <i>Grande-Bretagne</i>; the one is <i>Britannia
minor</i>, the other is <i>Britannia major</i>. In short,
the Britain of the island, the Great or Greater
Britain, was so called simply to distinguish it
from the Lesser Britain on the mainland.</p>

<p>Here, be it remarked, the Greater Britain is
the older, the Lesser is the younger; the Greater
is the mother-country, the Lesser is the colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
The Lesser Britain of the mainland never took that
name till it was settled by men fleeing from the
Greater Britain in the island. Now in the sense in
which we have of late years heard the phrase
“Greater Britain,” all this has been turned the other
way. “Great Britain” is not simply opposed to
a Lesser Britain; it is opposed to a Britain which
is confessedly great, but, it would seem, not so
great as the Greater. And of these the one which
is simply Great is the elder; the Greater is the
younger; the Great is the mother-country, the
ruling country; the Lesser is the plantation, the
dependency, or rather an aggregate of plantations
and dependencies all over the world. The change,
the contrast, between the old use of “Major
Britannia” and the new use of “Greater Britain”
is so very singular that one is driven to ask
whether those who brought in the new use ever
had the old one in their thoughts at all.</p>

<p>But the question becomes more curious still
when we bear in mind that there was in a distant
age of the world an use of a kindred phrase which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
is strikingly like, not the old, but the new use
of the phrase “Greater Britain.” As there was a
Greater and a Lesser Britain, so there was, perhaps
not a Lesser, but assuredly a Greater Greece. And
the Greater Greece did not answer to the “Major
Britannia” of our older use, but to the “Greater
Britain” of our newer. The Greater Greece was
not an older Greece from which settlers went forth,
as they went forth from the Greater Britain of
old, to found a younger and a lesser. The Greater
Greece, like the Greater Britain of modern times,
was an assemblage of settlements from the elder
Greece which were deemed, or deemed themselves,
to have become greater than the mother-country.
The Great or the Greater Greece (<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Ἡ μεγάλη Ἑλλάς</span>,
<i>Magna Græcia</i>, <i>Major Græcia</i>) became the received
geographical name for the Greek colonies in
Southern Italy. And they may be thought to
have deserved the name in that short and brilliant
time when those colonies distinctly outstripped the
mother-country, when Sybaris and Tarentum
ranked among the greatest cities of the earth, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
brilliant and flourishing, beyond doubt, than
Athens or Sparta or Corinth or any other of the
cities of the older Hellenic land.</p>

<p>As in the former case the contrast, so in this
case the analogy, is so striking that we again
cannot help asking whether those who brought
in the modern phrase of “Greater Britain” ever
had it in their minds? One point of unlikeness
however must be mentioned. By “Greater Britain”
seems now to be commonly meant the whole aggregate
of the scattered colonies and dependencies
of the Great or Lesser Britain&mdash;those names have
in the new use become synonymous&mdash;all over the
world. But the name Greater Greece by no means
took in all the scattered Greek colonies all over
the world; it was confined to a single group of
them. The name seems hardly to have spread
from Southern Italy even to the neighbouring
island of Sicily; it was certainly never applied
to the Greek settlements in Asia or Libya or
any other part of the world. Indeed the name
had a peculiar fitness as applied to the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
settlements in Southern Italy which it could not
have had elsewhere. The geographical structure
of the land enabled Southern Italy to put on the
character of a second Greece in a way in which
none other among the lands in which Greeks
settled could put it on. Everywhere else out of
old Greece there was merely a Greek fringe along
the coast. For the Greek settlements were planted
mainly on islands and promontories, along the
coasts of solid continents the inland parts of
which remained barbarian. Even in Sicily the
Greek settlements strictly so called were little
more than a fringe; the inland parts of the island
did indeed in the end become Greek; but it was
not by real Greek settlement, but by the spread
of the Greek tongue and of Greek culture among
men of other nations who became Greek by adoption.
In Southern Italy alone, the shape of the
land, branching off into two narrow peninsulas,
enabled Greek settlement to become something
more than a fringe on the coast, and to spread, as
in the older Greek land, from sea to sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Thus then there were two lands, an older and
a newer, in which it might be said, at all events
at the first aspect, that the whole land was Greek.
No doubt there was this difference, that in the
older Greece all was, as far as we can see, Greek
in the strictest sense, while in the younger Greece
much was Greek only by assimilation and adoption.
In the older Greece, if any relics lived on
from times and people older than the first Hellenic
settlements, they had been assimilated to the Greek
mass before recorded history began. The existence
in old Greece of any people earlier than the Greeks
is matter of legend, of guess, of scientific inference,
not matter of direct evidence. In the younger
Greece of the Italian colonies, the existence of
earlier inhabitants whom the Greeks found in
possession, and who long lived on by the side of
the Greeks, is as certain as the existence of earlier
inhabitants in our own American and Australian
colonies. But the earlier inhabitants whom the
Greek settlers found in Southern Italy were indeed
unlike those whom the English settlers found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
in America and Australia. Not very far removed,
so some have thought, from the Greeks in blood,
in any case belonging to the same great branch
of the human family, the nations of the extreme
south of Italy, like their neighbours of Sicily,
had a special power of adapting themselves to
Greek ways, of adopting Greek culture, of making
themselves in short Greeks by adoption. They
did not die out before the new settlers, like the
savages of America or Australia; they were able
to rise to the higher civilization of the strangers
who settled down among them, and to become
members of the same body. This is one of the
most marked differences between the old Greek
settlements and the settlements of modern Europeans.
The settlements of different European
nations have taken different courses, but there has
been nothing exactly answering to the process
by which so large a part of the barbarian neighbours
of the old Greek colonies became adopted
Hellênes. In the case of our own settlements,
the spread of British settlement or dominion has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
meant either the gradual dying out of the native
races, as in America or Australia, or else, as in
India, their survival as a distinct and subject
people. In no case have English settlers mingled
to any important extent with the native races;
in no case have the natives to any great extent
put on the outward seeming of Englishmen. Something
more like this result has taken place in
the colonies of Spain. There the mingled race, the
natives of unmixed race who have adopted at
least the Spanish tongue, are important elements
which have nothing answering to them in the
colonies of England. The nearest approach to
these elements to be found in any English colony
must be looked for in the grotesque imitation
of English ways where real assimilation is impossible.
This we see, not on the part of the
barbarians whom the English settlers found
dwelling in the settled lands, but on the part of
another race of barbarians whom they afterwards
imported for their own ends. The negro of the
Western continent and islands has truly nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
answering to him in any part of the Hellenic
world. And, in the other case, while the process
which made Sicily and Southern Italy Greek
was mainly the raising of the older inhabitants
to a higher level, the process which has made a
large part of America in some sort Spanish has
been largely the sinking of the European settler
to a lower level. In the Greek and in the English
case, it has been the higher civilization of the
time that has been extended, and that by milder
means in the Greek case than in the English.
In the Spanish case we can hardly say that the
highest civilization has been extended. If one
race has risen, the other has fallen. This result
nowhere took place in the Greek settlements, even
where the Greek settlers, while communicating so
much to the older inhabitants, did adopt something
from them back again. On the whole, the work
was a work of raising, not of sinking; but it is
needful to remember that, when we speak of the
narrow peninsulas of Southern Italy becoming
Greek from sea to sea, we mean that they largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
became Greek by the adoption of the earlier
inhabitants into the Greek body. When we
speak of the vast mainland of North America
becoming wholly European, mainly English, from
Ocean to Ocean, we mean that it has become
so, not by the adoption of the earlier people
by invaders who were also teachers, but by
the gradual vanishing of the earlier people before
invaders who to them at least have been
destroyers.</p>

<p>Now this difference is one that follows
directly from the difference in scale between the
world in which the old Greek settlers lived and
the world in which modern European nations
live. This difference in scale is a thing which
we must remember at every step. The Greek,
in planting his settlements round the coasts of
his own Mediterranean Sea, had nowhere to deal
with races of men so utterly unlike his own
as the races with whom modern Europeans have
had to deal in planting their settlements in the
islands and continents of the Ocean. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
among whom the Greek settled were mainly men
of the same great family as himself, men capable
of being raised, by a swifter or slower process,
to his own level. His world did indeed take
in, as ours does, nations of ancient and rival
civilizations altogether distinct from his own, but
it was not among those nations that he planted
his colonies. Where the Egyptian had dwelled
from an immemorial antiquity, where the Phœnician
had planted his abiding colonies in the first dawn
of European history, there the Greek in his best
days never settled; Egypt did in the end become in
some sort part of the Greek world; but it was not
by settlement from free Greece, but by the conquests
of the Macedonian kings. Egypt under the
Ptolemies was like India now, a land conquered
but not, strictly speaking, colonized, a land in
which the older nation kept on its own older life
alongside of the intruding life of the younger
settlers. But it marks the narrow area of the old
Greek world, that Egypt, in some sort its India,
in some sort its China, came within the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
limits of that world; it was a land whose shores
were washed by the same waters that washed the
shores of Hellas. This difference of scale must
never be forgotten while we are comparing or
contrasting the days of old Greece with our days.
But while we ever bear in mind the difference,
we must ever beware of being led away by
the misleading inferences which shallow talkers
have often drawn from that difference. The nature
of man is the same, whether he has a wider or
a narrower sphere for his work; and the narrower
sphere has some advantages over the wider. It
is in small communities, in commonwealths of a
single city, where men are brought closer together
than in greater states, where every man has a
personal share in the political life of the community,
that the faculties of man are raised to the highest
level and sharpened to the finest point. It is, from
a political point of view, the great merit of modern
scientific discoveries that they have enabled the
people of a great community, of a kingdom or
commonwealth covering a great space, to have that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
direct personal knowledge of the political life of
the community of which they are members, that
direct personal share in it, which once could not
be had save where the state was confined to the
territory of a single city. Instead of despising
earlier times because they had not printing and
railways and telegraphs, let us rather say that
printing and railways and telegraphs were needed
to raise large states to the level of small ones.
By means of those inventions the Englishman of
our day has become far more like an Athenian of
the age of Periklês than his forefathers were in
any earlier time. A hundred years ago, even
fifty years ago, the utmost the ordinary Englishman
could do was now and then to give a vote,
if he chanced to have one, at a parliamentary
election, and to read or hear the most meagre
accounts of what was going on in Parliament and
elsewhere in public life. Very few Englishmen
ever saw or heard Walpole or Pulteney, Pitt or
Fox. Now the whole land has well-nigh become a
single city; we see and hear our leading men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
almost daily; they walk before us as the leaders
of the Athenian democracy walked before their
fellow-citizens; they take us into their counsels;
they appeal to us as their judges; we have in short
a share in political life only less direct than the
share of the Athenian freeman, a share which our
forefathers, even two or three generations back,
never dreamed of. But without the help of modern
scientific discoveries, this active share in public
affairs on the part of the mass of the inhabitants
of a large country would have been simply a dream.
Or look at a matter which more directly concerns
the immediate subject of this discourse, look at the
vast developement of English political life in the
great English land beyond the Ocean; can any
man believe that a hundred years back Maine,
Florida, and California could have been kept
together as a political whole by any power short
of a despotism? Could those distant lands have
acted as parts of one free political body, if they
had had no means of intercourse with one another
swifter than the speed of a horse? It is by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
help of modern discoveries that the federal systems
of old Greece can be reproduced on a gigantic
scale, that a single Union of states can embrace a
continent stretching from Ocean to Ocean instead of
a peninsula stretching from sea to sea. In short,
instead of despising those ancient communities
which were the earliest form of European political
life, we should rejoice that in many things we
have gone back to the earliest form of European
political life, that the discoveries of modern times
have enabled the free states of old times to arise
again, but to arise again, no longer on the scale
of cities but on the scale of nations.</p>

<p>When then we compare the colonial system of
modern times, like any other feature of modern
political life, with the thing answering to it in the
political life of the old Greek city-commonwealths,
we must never forget the difference of area on
which the political life of the two periods has been
acted; but we must never allow ourselves to fancy
that difference of area, any more than distance of
time, wholly shuts us off from political fellowship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
with those earlier times or makes their experience
of none effect for our political instruction. The
communities of those days were cities, the communities
of our days are nations; but cities and
nations alike share in a common political life in
which many of the ages that went between their
days and ours had no share. The Greek settlements,
like the Phœnician settlements before
them, were settlements of cities, not of nations,
not of kingdoms or of commonwealths on the
scale of kingdoms. Till the political needs of a
later age taught the Greek that several cities
might be combined in a federal union, his whole
political life had gathered round the single independent
city as its essential unit. Every Greek
city was not independent; but every Greek city
deemed itself wronged if it was not independent;
when its independence was lost, it was, within all
Hellenic lands, lost by the rule of city over
city. And the rule of city over city, if it took
away the independence of the subject city as
an equal power among other powers, did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
wipe out its essential character as a separate
city-commonwealth. The dependent city was not
incorporated like an annexed land; it was not
held in bondage like a subject province; it remained
a city, with more or less of freedom in
its local affairs, though bound, as against other
powers, to follow the lead of the ruling city.
The city was all in all; the smallness of the
community, the narrowness of its area, brought
every citizen face to face with his fellows and his
leaders; it brought with it a fulness of political
life, an extension of political power and political
interests to every citizen, to which larger states
have reached only by painful steps and by help
of the inventions which have in some sort made
time and distance cease to be. The Greek was
before all things a citizen; his political life was
wholly local; his powers and duties as a citizen
could be discharged only in his own city, on
some spot hallowed by old tradition, and hallowed
most commonly in the more formal sense by
the abiding presence and guardianship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
patron deity. He felt in the strongest sense the
tie of membership of a community, the tie of
all the duties which spring from membership of
a community. For his city he would live and
toil and die, but he would live and toil and die
for it, because it was the whole of which he
was himself a part. He owed faith and loyalty
to his city&mdash;loyalty in its true and ancient
sense of obeying the law, the law which he
might be called on to help to administer, which
he might, in some rare case, be called on to
help to change. He might keep that faith and
loyalty far away from his own city by doing
all that he could in foreign lands for the interest
and honour of that city. But in no other sense
could he carry his citizenship with him beyond
the bounds of the territory of his city; elsewhere
he might act as a soldier or as an envoy,
but hardly in the strictest sense as a citizen.
The tie was local; the duty was local; of a
personal tie of allegiance binding him to a
personal superior, bringing with it personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
duties which should everywhere dog his steps,
which could not be cast off in any corner of the
world&mdash;of loyalty in that sense, the old Greek,
the old Phœnician, had never any thought in
his mind.</p>

<p>The change in the meaning of the word “loyalty”
well marks that leading political characteristic of
modern Europe which stands out in the fullest
contrast to the political thoughts of the ancient
commonwealths. Loyalty, once simply <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">legalitas</i>,
obedience to the law, has for ages meant&mdash;when
it has not meant something far baser&mdash;no longer
obedience to the law, no longer duty to a community
as a community, but faith and duty
owed by one man to another man. It may be
simply the personal duty of a man to his lord,
the tie of chosen or hereditary comradeship, the
tie known by the oldest Greek and by the
oldest German, an ennobling tie indeed as
regards the man himself, a tie which may lead
to lofty prowess or to pure self-sacrifice, the tie
of the true companions of Brihtnoth on the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
of Maldon, when on the place of slaughter each
man lay thegn-like, his lord hard by. Or it
may take the less poetic, the more political
shape, in which the thought of the commonwealth
does come in, but where the commonwealth
is perhaps overshadowed by its chief, perhaps
only embodied in him. The notion of personal
allegiance, a notion which could have been
hardly understood by either the aristocratic or
the democratic Greek, has been the essence of
the political system of Europe for many ages.
It is a notion which grows up as naturally in
a kingdom as the other notion, the notion of
duty to the community, grows up in a commonwealth
which knows no abiding personal head.
It by no means shuts out the notion of duty
to the community; but, as has been just now
implied, it has a tendency to overshadow it.
In the higher types of the class, in the French
nobles, for instance, under the old monarchy, the
feeling of personal loyalty, of devotion to the
particular man who wore the crown, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
reached its highest point since the days of the old
Greek and Teutonic comradeship. It was a feeling
that was by no means wholly degrading; but it
tended to put in the shade, if not wholly to crush
out, feelings higher and worthier. Men looked so
much to the King of France, they looked so much
on France as embodied in his person, that there
was small room left in their thoughts for France
herself, for France as embodied in her people.
Since kingdoms have put on more nearly the
practical shape of commonwealths, this extravagant
devotion to a single man has been somewhat toned
down, and more room is gained for feelings coming
nearer to those which were felt in a free democracy
of old. But the radical distinction still remains
between the leading political ideas of the state
which acknowledges a prince as its sovereign and
the state which knows no sovereign but the commonwealth
itself. The primary and formal duty
of the member of a state that acknowledges a
prince, a duty to which in many cases he is bound
by direct personal promises, is a personal duty to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
person. It is a duty which he cannot throw off
under any circumstances of time and place; it
follows him wherever he goes; on the most distant
foreign soil he remains the subject of the prince
in whose dominions he drew his breath. While
the active duties of the citizen of a commonwealth
can hardly be discharged beyond the territories of
that commonwealth, the duties of the subject of
a king, the subject, that is, of a personal master,
are as binding on one part of the earth’s surface
as on another. I have just used words which go
to the root of the matter. I have used the words
“citizen” and “subject.” The difference between
the two conceptions can nowhere put on a more
living shape than in the use of those two names.
The Greek would have deemed himself degraded
by the name of “subject.” To him the word that
best translates it expressed the position of men
who, either in their own persons or in the person
of the cities to which they belonged, were shorn
of the common rights of every city, of every
citizen. We use the word “subject” daily without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
any feeling of being lowered by it. It has become
so familiar that it is assumed as the natural phrase
to express membership of a political body, and it
is often used when it is quite out of place. I
once read, and that in a formal document, of a
“Swiss subject,” and I had the pleasure of explaining
that there had been no subjects, no <i>Unterthanen</i>,
in Switzerland since <span class="locked">1798<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>. And the question comes,
What are we to say instead? “Swiss citizen,”
“French citizen,” “citizen of the United States,”
have this awkwardness about them that the community
whose membership they express is not a
city. The very awkwardness points to the main
difference between the world of old Hellas and
the world of modern Europe, the difference in
scale. Be it kingdom or be it commonwealth, the
state with which modern politics have to deal is
not a city but something vastly greater.</p>

<p>Now there is no branch of political life on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
these distinctions tell with greater force than on
the work of planting new homes of any people
beyond the sea. The colonies, the settlements, the
plantations, of that elder world whose range of
settlement was the Mediterranean were settlements
of citizens who set forth from cities. The colonies,
the settlements, the plantations of the newer world
whose range of settlement has been the Ocean have
been mainly settlements of subjects who set forth
from kingdoms. Hence, while in almost every
other point the two systems of settlement are so
wonderfully alike, in all those points which immediately
follow from this essential deference they
stand utterly aloof from each other. The men who
planted Greater Greece&mdash;whether we mean thereby
the land once really so called or any other part of
the Greek colonial world&mdash;were citizens of cities.
The men who planted Greater Britain, if so we are
to call it, like the men who planted Greater Portugal,
Greater Spain, or Greater France, were
subjects of kingdoms. There is but one exception.
The colonies of the United Netherlands were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
colonies planted by a commonwealth, and of all
European colonies they have departed most widely
from the old Greek model. But though colonies
of a commonwealth, though colonies of a commonwealth
in which cities played the chief part,
they could hardly be called colonies of cities.
They were colonies of a great confederation, of
an aristocratic confederation, which had in many
things more in common with kingdoms than
with independent cities. They were colonies
planted in a colonial world in which the colonies
of kingdoms had set the model. The kingdom
then, and not the commonwealth, has been the
essential colonizing element in modern Europe.
The colonies of modern Europe have been in the
main colonies of subjects, not of citizens. Each
alike, citizen and subject, carried with him that
form of political life which was natural to each.
The Greek colonist, citizen of a city, planted a city.
Severed from his native city, severed perhaps by
such a world of waters as that which parts Euboia
from Sicily or by such a wider world of waters as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
parts Phôkaia from Gaul, he could no longer remain
a citizen of his own city; he could no longer
discharge the duties of citizenship on a distant
spot; he could no longer join in the debates of
the old <i>agorê</i>; he could no longer join in the
worship of the old temple; but he must still
have some <i>agorê</i> and some temple; he must still
have a city to dwell in, a city in which still to
dwell the life of a free Greek, when he could no
longer live that life in the city of his birth. So
he planted a city, a free city, a city that knew no
lord, that knew no ruling city, a city furnished
from the first with all that was needed for the
life of a Greek commonwealth, a city free and
independent from its birth. And he dwelled in the
new city as he had once dwelled in the old; he
gave himself to make the new worthy of the
old, the daughter worthy of the mother. But
did he thereby deem that he had ceased to be
a Greek? Did he deem that he had severed
himself from Greece? Did he even deem that he
had broken off from all duty and fellowship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
towards the city from whence he had set forth?
No; dwell where he might, the Greek remained
a Greek; wherever he went he carried Hellas
with him; in Asia, in Libya, in Sicily, in Italy,
in Gaul, far away by the pillars that guarded
the mouth of Ocean, far away in the inmost recesses
of the Inhospitable Sea, wherever he trod, a
new Hellas, if we will, a Greater Hellas, sprang
into being; on those new shores of Hellas he
kept his old Hellenic heart, his old Hellenic
fellowship; he still kept the tongue and customs
of his folk; he clave to the gods of his folk; he
could go to the old land and consult their oracles,
he could claim his place in their sacred games, as
freely as if he still dwelled by the banks of the
Spartan Eurôtas or under the shadow of the holy
rock of Athens. And how fared he towards the
city of his birth, the <i>metropolis</i>, the mother-city
of his new home, the birthplace and cradle of
himself and his fellow-citizens of his new city?
Political tie none remained; no such tie could
remain among a system of cities. Parent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
child were on the political side necessarily parted;
the colonist could exercise no political rights in
the mother-city, nor did the mother-city put
forward any claim to be lady and mistress of her
distant daughter. Still the love, the reverence,
due to a parent was never lacking. The tie of
memory, the tie of kindred, the tie of religion,
were of themselves so strong that no tie of
political allegiance was needed to make them
stronger. The sacred fire on the hearth of the
new city was kindled from the hearth of its
mother; the parent was honoured with fitting
honours, her gods were honoured with fitting offerings;
her citizens were welcomed as elder brethren
when they visited the younger city. And when
the child itself became a parent, when the new
city itself sent forth its colonies, the mother-city
of all was prayed to share in the work and
to send forth elder brethren of her own stock
to be leaders in the enterprise of her children.</p>

<p>In truth the ordinary story of the relations
between a Greek colony and its metropolis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
relations that is between a perfectly independent
state and another state to which it looks up
with traditional reverence, is perhaps the most
attractive feature of Greek political life. The
history of the relations between Corinth and Syracuse
is a pleasing tale throughout. During all
the centuries of the joint independence of the
two cities, the relations between the metropolis
and its great colony are ever fresh, ever friendly.
The Syracusan is not a Corinthian; the sea that
rolls between Ortygia and the Isthmus forbids
that. But he never forgets that he is a child of
Corinth, a child of Peloponnêsos; he cleaves with
pride to the local speech of his fathers; he cherishes
the worship of the gods and heroes of the city
of his fathers, their names and their legends live
on his lips; Syracuse may grow into a greater and
mightier city than her parent; but that Corinth is
the parent is a thought that never dies out from
any Syracusan heart. Yet the child is free and
independent, free and independent from its beginning.
Corinth makes not the slightest claim to authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
or superiority over Syracuse; but she is ever
ready to step in when any need on the part of Syracuse
calls for her help; she steps in as bound to
something which to her is dearer and more recked
of than the most cherished among allies who are
not her children. The mother-city steps in alike
when Syracuse is pressed by foreign enemies and
when she is torn by domestic seditions. She
acts as a mediator between Syracuse and her
foes; she shelters alike her banished patriots, her
banished tyrant, even the foreign enemy whom
Syracuse has spared and has given to her mother’s
keeping. And, a gift precious above all, she
sends her own deliverer to be in turn the deliverer
of his brethren. And this friendship
between Corinth and Syracuse is no friendship
that stands alone; it is the common tie which
binds Greek metropolis and Greek colony to one
another. And all this becomes the more striking
when we come to compare the tale of Corinth
and Syracuse with some really exceptional cases
in which the relations of metropolis and colony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
were less amiable. Strange to say, we can find
them in the history of this very Corinth and
this very Syracuse. No War of Independence, no
Declaration of Independence, was ever needed between
Corinth and Syracuse, because Syracuse was
from the beginning independent of her metropolis,
and therefore friendly to her metropolis. But
perhaps a declaration of independence, certainly a
war of independence, was needed between Corinth
and Korkyra, between Syracuse and Kamarina.
In each of those cases the metropolis did claim
some measure of authority over the colony. The
fruit of this departure from the common system
of Greek settlement was that abiding ill-will
between Korkyra and her parent Corinth which
stands out among the best known facts of Grecian
history. And yet perhaps in the only case where
we see Corinth and Korkyra acting together in
friendly guise, it shows that something of the better,
the more usual, feeling was not wholly banished
from Corinthian and Korkyraian hearts; we once
see the two cities join to do the duty of a parent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
and a sister as mediators on behalf of Syracuse
against an enemy. As for the other less famous
case, we read that Kamarina, a colony of Syracuse,
revolted against her metropolis and was swept
from the earth as a punishment. The doom
was heavy; the fault may have been grave; but
between Corinth and Syracuse, between Phôkaia
and Massalia, there was no room for revolt or for
its penalties.</p>

<p>Thus the old Greek citizen, in his settlements
beyond the sea, founded cities, cities free and
independent from the beginning. Let us see now
what the modern European colonist, subject of
a kingdom, has founded. He has founded settlements
of very various kinds in different cases;
but he has nowhere founded free and independent
cities, like the Greek and the Phœnician before him.
Cities indeed in one sense he has founded, vast
and mighty cities, busy seats of arts and industry
and commerce, but not cities in the elder sense,
cities independent from their birth, cities that
are born the political equals of the mightiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
kingdoms. Cities like these the subject of a
kingdom, bound wherever he goes to remain the
subject of a kingdom, can never found. But
what can be found instead? He cannot, in the
nature of things, found kingdoms; it is the
essence of his being that he and all that he has
should remain part of an existing kingdom. His
first act on entering an unknown land is to
declare it to be part of the dominions of the
prince from whose territories he has set forth.
Wherever he goes, whatever he does, he is tied
and hampered by the necessity of abiding in the
allegiance of his original sovereign. It is wonderful
to see how near some of the founders of
modern European settlements came to the creation
of really independent states. A slender line
indeed distinguished the elder colonies of New
England from states absolutely independent. The
interference of the mother-country was, in many
times and places, slight indeed. Still the final step
was never taken; they were not absolutely and
formally independent states, like the old settlements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
of Greece and Phœnicia. As all the world
knows, even those settlements where local freedom
was fullest, those which came most nearly to the
level of actual independence, needed a Declaration
of Independence, a War of Independence, to raise
them to its full level. The settlements of modern
Europe have not conformed to the pattern of
Syracuse and Massalia; they have followed the
exceptional pattern of Korkyra and Kamarina.
In Greek Asia then, in Greek Sicily, in the
Greater Greece itself on the forked peninsulas
of Italy, we see a gathering of Greek settlements,
each a free and independent city, each as
a free and independent city carrying on its own
political life, its questions, its disputes, perhaps
its wars, with some fellow city; but all alike
Greek, all glorying in the Hellenic name, all
looking back to old Hellas as the motherland,
each looking to its own mother-city, not with
the dread of a subject, not with the helplessness
of a child still in tutelage, but with the manly
deference of a child of full age, whose reverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
for his parent is none the less because he is no
longer a member of the household. By way of contrast
to that national life abiding in a new land, we
see, in vast regions of the American continent, lands
which once were English, which once were Spanish,
which are still English and Spanish as far as
common blood and speech and history can make
them so, but which have ceased to be English
or Spanish as political communities, and which
grudgingly acknowledge the English or Spanish
name. We see lands that parted in wrath from
the motherland, and by whom the wrath of that
parting has not wholly been forgotten. We see
lands whose independence, instead of growing
from the beginning with the good will of a
watchful parent, has been won by the sword
from the grasp of a parent who strove to keep
her children in subjection. And all this has been
the direct and necessary result of the theory of
political life which the founders of those English
and Spanish settlements carried with them.
Subjects of a kingdom could do no otherwise;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the theory of an allegiance which could never
be cast aside obliged their settlements to become
provinces, dependencies, whatever name is
chosen, of the motherland. They could not found
an independent kingdom any more than they
could found an independent city. Dependence,
tighter or slacker, was the necessity of the case.
But it was no less in the necessity of the case
that a day should come when even the slackest
form of dependence could be borne no longer.
That these colonies “are and ought to be free
and independent states” was a voice which could
not fail to be heard some day in Massachusetts
and Virginia; there was no need for it ever to
be heard in Syracuse or in Sybaris; for no man
doubted their freedom and independence from the
day of their first founding.</p>

<p>The mention of the independent colonies of
England, those which, by the necessity of the
Colonial system of modern Europe, were driven
to win their independence by the sword, suggests
one question of no small moment for our present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
inquiry. Does this popular phrase of “Greater
Britain” take in, or does it not take in, the United
States of America? I say the popular phrase,
because, as the phrase was first used by the writer
who I believe invented it, who certainly gave it
its first currency, it undoubtedly did take in the
United States. But I am not at all certain
whether it does or does not in the vague and
lax way in which the phrase is now often used
to add a flourish to a period. Now if the phrase
“Greater Britain” does not take in the United
States, it is certainly somewhat strange to shut
out from that name the mightiest offshoot of the
English folk. If it is meant to take them in,
I am afraid that we may sometimes be met with
a little unwillingness on the part of those whom
we would fain welcome within our pale. There
is the speaking fact, that, while the Greek of
Spain or of the Tauric Chersonêsos never doubted
as to his being a Greek, the Englishman even
of New England sometimes but grudgingly allows
himself to be an Englishman. This is the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of parting in anger; under the Greek system, there
was no room for parting at all. To the Greek
colonist the names of the motherland from which
he had set forth, of the folk from which he did
not sever himself in setting forth from that
motherland, suggested simple brotherhood, without
a thought of subjection or dependence. To the
descendant of English settlers in America, citizen,
of a vast commonwealth of English blood and
English speech, the English name has come to
suggest&mdash;it is hard to say what, but something
which the Greek name did not suggest to the
citizen of any Greek settlement beyond the sea.
He may accept it; but he accepts it with a
kind of effort, with a kind of second thoughts.
The fact is that the notion of allegiance has for
some centuries taken such root in men’s minds,
it has become so thoroughly the leading idea
of political life, it has become so largely the
definition of a separate political community, that
the English name has come, on both sides of
the Ocean, to carry with it some lurking flavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
of necessary allegiance to the English crown.
The Englishman of America shrinks from calling
himself an Englishman, lest that name
should unwittingly imply an allegiance which
his forefathers cast off. The Englishman of
Britain shrinks from bestowing the English
name on the Englishman of America, lest he
should seem to be wounding the national pride
of a people the very root of whose political life
was the denial of all English political allegiance.
Neither side seem able freely to grasp the truth
that was so clear to the mind of every Greek,
the truth that two or many communities may
be wholly distinct for every political purpose,
and may yet be members of one nation for
every other purpose of national life. I ask
again, Do the United States of America come
under the definition of “Greater Britain”? If
I rightly understand the use of the phrase,
“Greater Britain” is sometimes held to have the
same meaning as the phrase “British Empire.”
If so, then assuredly the United States of America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
do not come, and do not seek to come, within
such a definition as that. But sometimes the
phrase of “Greater Britain” seems rather to be
used as bearing the same meaning as another
phrase that we sometimes hear, that of “the
Federation of the English-speaking People.” Now
the people of the United States of America
surely form so large a part of the English-speaking
people that a federation which is meant
to take in all the branches of that people is
strangely imperfect if it leaves out a branch so
great and so fruitful as that which has spread
the English tongue from Ocean to Ocean.</p>

<p>Again, if the phrase “Greater Britain” is held
to be equivalent, not to the federation of the
English-speaking people but to the “British
Empire,” then another difficulty meets us. The
Imperial state of all, that Empire of India set
alone in its august rank above the mere kingdoms
of lowlier Europe, may indeed be looked
on as the head and front of the Imperial power
of Britain; it can hardly be looked on as itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
a Greater Britain. Greek Kings, at any rate
Macedonian Kings, once ruled from Pharos to
Syênê, from the shores of the Ægæan to the
banks of the Indus, yet no man would ever
have applied the name of Greater Greece, or
even of Greater Macedonia, to the Greek dominion
over Egypt and the East. The Greater Greece in
Italy was Greater Greece because it had truly
become Greek. The Greek dominion in Egypt
and the East could not be said to form a Greater
Greece, because those lands never became Greek;
they received at most a Greek fringe, a Greek
veneer, a slight outer garment of Hellenism
spread over an essentially barbarian body. And
if Egypt or Asia was not Greater Greece, surely
India is Greater Britain still less. There is
there no abiding British element drawing to it
the science, the learning, the whole art and skill
of the British world. For if Asia and Egypt
never became Greek, yet within their borders
Alexandria and Antioch became renowned as the
greatest of Greek colonies, the courts of kings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the universities of scholars, the centres of the
intellectual life of Greece when its political life
was shrinking up within narrow bounds indeed.
Greece looked elsewhere for her greater self, and
Britain cannot fail to look elsewhere for her
greater self, and not where the influence of
Britain takes the shape, so largely of dominion,
so slightly of assimilation. All that I am asking
for is clearness of speech; I seek to have words
well defined, and that is all. I do not profess
myself to define the phrase “Greater Britain;”
I only remark that, if it is held to be the same
as the “British Empire,” it cannot be the same
as the “Federation of English-speaking people;”
and that if it be either the one or the other,
certain consequences would seem to follow which
it seems to me are now and then forgotten.</p>

<p>But one thing is certain. If the phrase “Greater
Britain” answers to “federation of the English-speaking
people,” if it takes in the English-speaking
people of the United States of America,
it also takes in great communities of English-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>speaking
people in America, Australasia, Africa,
and other parts of the islands and continents of
the Ocean, which are not in the same political
condition as the United States. Herein comes
a great political problem, which never presented
itself to any mind in the old colonizing days
of Phœnicia and Greece, and which never presented
itself to any mind in modern Europe till
quite lately. The older state of things was
familiar with distant and scattered settlements
which none the less formed a national whole,
but which stood in no political relation either
to one another or to the mother-cities from
whence they were settled. The later state of
things was no less familiar with distant and
scattered settlements, perhaps forming a national
whole, perhaps not, but in either case united to
the mother-country, the ruling country, by a
common tie of dependence. The fact that so
many European colonies which were held in
this relation have parted asunder from the
states on which they were dependent, the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
case of all, the winning of independence by
thirteen American colonies of England, the
wonderful growth of those colonies in their
new character as independent states, has for
a long time past drawn men’s minds to
the relations between mother-country and
colony. The relation once so common in the
modern world, the relation of mere dependence,
sometimes almost of bondage, is no longer maintained
on any hand. In the chief colonies of
Great Britain at all events, every care has been
taken, while keeping the relation of dependence,
to make dependence as little irksome as may
be. The fullest local freedom has been given;
dependence has in appearance sunk to little
more than the retention of a common allegiance
to a common sovereign. Of late keener eyes
have seen somewhat more clearly what has
lurked beneath this, at first sight, very pleasing
relation. In its internal affairs the colony is,
in all seeming, as free as the mother-country;
I say in all seeming, because even in the freest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
colonial constitutions there is still a certain
hidden power which may ever and anon step
forth in a way in which it never can step
forth again in the mother-country. And the
fullest independence in local affairs cannot wholly
put out of sight the fact that in all strictly
national affairs the freest of colonies is as
dependent as ever. The greatest and freest of
colonies may at any moment find itself plunged
into a war which may suit the interests or the
fancies of the people of Great Britain, but which
may in no way suit the interests or the fancies of
the people of the colony. It is to meet this difficulty
that schemes have been of late largely
proposed for bringing about a nearer union
between the mother-country and the colonies,
and that in some shape other than that of
dependence. Mother-country and colonies are
to form one political whole, but a political whole
in which no member is to claim superiority, or
at any rate authority, over any other. I am
not now arguing for or against such a scheme;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
this is not the place to do so. I wish simply,
as a matter of accuracy of thought, to put some
questions as to what is really meant, so that
we may fully understand what it is that we are
talking about. And I wish further, by way
of historical inference, to point out some facts
which may perchance be helpful in making up
our minds on the subject which we are talking
about.</p>

<p>I would therefore ask again, Do “Greater
Britain,” “Imperial Federation,” “Federation of
the English-speaking People,” mean one thing
or two or three? The difficulty is that a great
part of what it is fashionable to call “the
British Empire” does not consist of English-speaking
people, and that a large part of the
English-speaking people do not form part of the
“British Empire.” The existence of India, the
existence of the United States, surround us
with difficulties at every step. Then again,
What is Imperial Federation? If it is Imperial,
how is it Federal? If it is Federal, how is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Imperial? Is the present German Empire to
be the type? That is in a certain sense an
Imperial Federation, because its chief bears the
title of Emperor. But then some may think
that it is too Imperial to be exactly Federal;
some may think that the position of some of
its smaller members does not practically differ
very much from a position of dependence. One
cannot help thinking that the colony of Victoria,
though it is still a dependency, enjoys more
of practical independence than the duchy of
Oldenburg, which is a sovereign state. Does
the Imperial Federation take in India or not?
Let us be careful how we answer. If the
Empire of India is left out of the Federation,
how is the Federation Imperial? I am not sure
that I always know the exact meaning of the
words “Empire” and “Imperial;” but there is one
part of the Queen’s dominions, and one only, in
which she bears the title of Empress, and it would
be strange if, in forming the Queen’s dominions into
an Imperial Federation, her one Imperial possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
should be the only part of her dominions which
is left out. But if, on the other hand, the Empire
of India is taken into the Federation, if all its
inhabitants receive, as surely they must receive,
the same federal rights as the inhabitants of
other parts of the Federation, then we may be
allowed to ask, how the Federation of which
the Empire of India is a part will be a Federation
of the English-speaking people or a
Federation at all. The area and population of
the Empire of India are so great that, in its
federal aspect, as the state or canton of India,
it will hold a place in the Imperial Federation
of Greater Britain at least as overwhelming as
Prussia now holds in the Imperial Federation of
Germany. Where would Great Britain be, where
would Australia or Canada or South Africa be,
alongside of such a yoke-fellow? It will be a
serious question in such a case what is to
become of the white-skinned, European, Christian,
minority, outvoted, as it must always be, by
millions on millions of dark-skinned Mussulmans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and Hindoos who can hardly be reckoned among
the English-speaking people. I am not arguing
for or against all this; it may be the right
thing for so small an island as ours to be
taught its fitting place in the world. I only
ask whether those who talk about “Imperial
Federation” have always stopped to think exactly
what they mean by the words. And I would
ask whether the only scheme which would seem
to be correctly described by the name of Imperial
Federation could be sung or said, with any
degree of harmony, to the tune of “Rule Britannia.”</p>

<p>Of course it may be that the tune of “Rule
Britannia” may have come to mean the rule, not of
the Great, but of the Greater Britain. Only we are
again followed by the difficulty of settling what
the Greater Britain is. India and its Empire are,
to say the least, a puzzle. But passing by that
difficulty for a moment, there is to be in any case a
Federation of some kind, a Federation of very
scattered members, members which have hitherto
looked up to a common parent as their abiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
head, in truth their abiding ruler. And now
that head, that ruler, is asked to do what no ruling
state in the world has ever been asked to do. I
feel certain that not a few of those who talk about
an Imperial Federation of the English-speaking
people use those words as having, perhaps a high-sounding,
perhaps a patriotic ring, but without
ever stopping to think what the words which they
use, if they imply anything, really do imply. Yet
the word “Federation” has a meaning. Different
federations may take, and have taken, very different
shapes, but, if they are to be federations at all, one
thing is of the very essence. The states that
unite to make the federation, while they keep
certain powers in their own hands, give up certain
other powers to a central body, a body which
speaks and acts in the name, not of this or that
state, but of the whole body of states. And the
powers that they give up to this central body are
those powers which are strictly national, those in
the exercise of which the nation, as such, comes
across the other nations and powers of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
This nation, any other nation, cannot have any
dealings with the State of New York; all its dealings
must be with the United States of America.
Now we, this kingdom of Great Britain, have been
for a good while accustomed to hold the same
position in the world as the United States of
America, and we have been withal accustomed to
hold it for a much longer time than the United
States of America have. Are we willing to give
up this position, and to sink to the position of the
State of New York or the State of Delaware?
For this is what Federation really means. Some
other conceivable form of union may conceivably
mean something else; but it is Federation that
is talked of, and this is what Federation means.
Hitherto the Parliament of Great Britain, that is
the King, Lords, and Commons of Great Britain,
has been a sovereign assembly, an assembly which
knows no superior on earth and which knows no
limit to the range of its powers. If Great Britain
becomes one member of a Federation alongside of
the British colonies in Australia and Canada, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Parliament of Great Britain will cease to be all
this; it will become a subordinate legislature, like
the legislature of the State of Rhode Island or of
the Canton of Schwyz, a legislature which can deal
only with its own subordinate range of subjects,
and may not meddle with that higher range of
subjects which it has given over to the Federal
power. The question indeed may further arise
whether any Great Britain, any Parliament of
Great Britain, should be allowed to remain at all.
It may be thought fairer, nay, it may even be in
the interest of Great Britain itself as getting it
more votes in the Federal body, that Great Britain
should no more be heard of, and that England,
Scotland, and Wales, nay, for ought I know,
Wessex and Mercia, Lothian and Gwynedd, should
all enter the Union as separate States. I am not
arguing for or against all this. I only again ask
whether those who talk about Imperial Federation
have always weighed all these chances, and also
how far any of them is consistent with the tune
of “Rule Britannia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
As a matter of fact, no real Federation was ever
formed in this fashion&mdash;for I cannot look on the
modern German Empire as a Federation in more
than form. The chief Federations of the world
have been formed in quite another way. A
number of small states, in face of some greater
power that threatened them, each needing the help
of its fellows against the common enemy, have
agreed, while still keeping each one its separate
being, to become one state for all purposes that
touch their relations to other powers. This
description suits all the main federations of
the world, old and new. In forming such
federations, it is plain that each member gives
up somewhat of its formal rank as an absolutely
independent state. But this small self-lowering
is more than outweighed by the far
greater security that it gains for preserving
independence in any shape. It is quite another
case when a great power, an ancient power, a
ruling power, is asked to come down from its
place, to rank for the future simply as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
member alongside of its own dependencies, even
though most of those dependencies are its own
children. For this, it must be remembered, and
nothing else, is what Federation really means.
And it is what no ruling power on earth has ever
yet consented to, and what we may suspect that no
ruling power ever will consent to. This process
must not be confounded with another form of
union, which is perfectly conceivable, but which is
wholly different, and which is not Federation.
Though a ruling state is not likely to stoop to the
level of its dependencies, yet many a ruling state
has found it wise to incorporate its dependencies in
its own body. The growth of the Roman Empire,
by gradually admitting one class of dependencies
after another to the full Roman franchise, is the
great example of all. By this process the ruling
state gives up nothing; it simply admits others, not
so much to its own level as into its own substance.
The ruling state does not sink; the dependencies,
as separate communities, neither rise nor sink; as
communities they cease to exist; but their citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
or subjects are raised to the level of citizens or
subjects of the ruling power. If any one should
propose, not that Great Britain and her dependencies
should enter into a Federation, but that the United
Kingdom should absorb its dependencies, that their
inhabitants should all be represented in the Parliament
of the United Kingdom, any objection to such
a scheme as this would be objections of quite
another kind from the objections which beset the
scheme of Federation. The difficulty of carrying
out such a scheme is almost wholly a physical one.
Can such distant and scattered elements be thus
joined together in a political body one and indivisible?
Have those scientific discoveries of
which I spoke earlier in this discourse advanced so
far as to annihilate time and distance on such a
scale as this? I say nothing either way; I simply
wish to point out the difference between two
utterly distinct proposals which are likely to be
confounded. I add only one warning. Vast
territories have been united, both on the Federal
system, as in the United States, and on the system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of more thorough union into a single body, as in
the Empire of old Rome. But hitherto they have
always been continuous territories. Provinces and
states, however distant, have been physically one;
they shade off gradually into one another; it is
possible to walk from the furthest point at one end
to the furthest point at the other. It seems another
thing to unite in the same way a mass of territories,
not only at vast distances from one another, but
utterly isolated. Carthage, Venice, Genoa, have
held a scattered dominion of this kind; but it has
been merely a dominion. With them there was no
federal tie, no political communion of any kind;
there was simply the uncontrolled authority of the
ruling city. The question is whether federation
or any other form of political union is possible
among members so widely scattered. It may
be true that it takes no longer time now to go
from New Zealand to Westminster than it took
to go from Shetland to Westminster at the time
of the Union of Great Britain. But Shetland and
Westminster, though not parts of one continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
territory, are parts of one geographical whole.
There are no foreign waters to cross, no foreign
lands to pass by, on the road between them.</p>

<p>I am not, I must end by again saying, here
either to recommend any practical course or to
dissuade from any practical course. My business
is a lowlier one. One part of it is the pedantic
business of calling attention to a process which is
very needful before we begin to discuss any
practical course, the process of finding out exactly
what it is that we have to argue for and
against. I am not arguing for or against
federation or any other scheme; I simply point
out what federation is, and what are the difficulties
about it. I am trying to show what is the real
meaning of that or of any other word, and thereby
to avoid the confusion of thought and often of
action which follows when a name which has
been long used to mean one thing is suddenly
turned about to mean something else. Another
part of my business is to suggest real analogies
and to warn against false ones. I have referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
largely to the experience of political communities
in ages very distant from our own time and on
a scale very different from the political communities
of our own time. I wish to point out
the real, instructive, practical, likeness which, with
a little pains, may be seen through much real and
more seeming unlikeness. Above all, I wish to
point out that some of the great inventions of
modern times, which might at first sight seem
to sever us more utterly than ever from those
small and ancient commonwealths, have really
brought us nearer to them. The great lesson
of history is that the nature of man, at any rate
of civilized European man, is the same in all times
and places, and that there is no time or place
whose experience may not supply us with some
teaching. But free states naturally supply the
best lessons for free states. The difference in scale
between the free states of various ages is after all
only an accidental difference which does not go to
the root of the matter. The difference is largely
part of that extension of the area of history which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
follows on the advance of civilized man, that
advance in which the creation of Greater Greece
in one age and of Greater Britain in another were
alike steps. The great thing to remember in these
matters is that the men of the earliest days of
civilized Europe, the elder brethren of the great
historic family of which we ourselves are members,
were neither, as men seemed to think a few generations
back, beings of a race above us, nor yet, as
some seem inclined to think now, beings so far
below us, or in a position so unlike our own, that
their experience can be of no use to us. Either of
these mistakes is alike fatal to a general grasp of
that unbroken history of the world of which the
earliest days of Greece are one stage and the
most modern days of England are another. Above
all, instead of despising those days of small
communities because of their ignorance of modern
inventions which they needed far less than we do,
let us rather rejoice that those inventions have
brought us who do need them nearer to the
political level of those early times. To me at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
least it is some satisfaction that the England in
which I now live is palpably more like the
Athens of the days of Periklês than was the
England in which I was born. And it is beyond
doubt the great scientific discoveries of modern
times which have largely helped to make it so.</p>

<h2 id="GEORGE">GEORGE WASHINGTON,<br />

THE EXPANDER OF ENGLAND.</h2>

<p>The day on which we are met is the day that
is honoured by a mighty commonwealth of our
own blood and speech as the birthday of its
founder. It is a day of rejoicing in every home
throughout the vastest of English lands, the land
where the tongue and laws of England have won
for themselves a wider dominion than the Empire
of Justinian or of Trajan. From the western brink
of that giant stream of Ocean of which the Greek
of old heard with wonder to the eastern brink of
that further Ocean of which Ptolemy and Strabo
never dreamed, the name of a man of English blood,
of English speech, bearing the simple name of an
English village, is uttered, as on this day, with
the same feelings with which the men of elder
commonwealths uttered the names of Brutus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Timoleôn. The Teutonic clan which, in some
unrecorded settlement of our folk, planted on a
spot of Northern English soil the obscure name
of the Wascingas, dreamed not that the name of
their little mark, unrecorded in the annals of the
elder England, should become the first of names
in a younger and a vaster England, the meeting-place
of a wider federation than that which met
at Aigion or that which meets at Bern. Still
less could they have dreamed that the city which
was after twelve hundred years and more to take
the name of their new-born township was to take
its name because that name had passed as the name
of an English house from the banks of the Wear
to the banks of the Potomac, to be borne in due
succession by that one member of that house who
was to make it a name of glory for all ages.
From Washington in the bishopric of Durham to
Washington in the district of Columbia, the bound
is greater, the contrast is more startling, than
when we pass from Boston in Holland to Boston
in Massachusetts, or even when we pass from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Melbourne with her three towers in the old land
of the Five Boroughs to that Melbourne in the
greatest of islands where even the younger Washington
may seem ancient. Happy indeed was the
luck that the man whose birth we celebrate this
day bore by descent from his fathers the good
Teutonic name of an English <i>gens</i> and an English
township. Under no system of nomenclature but
that of our fathers could the name of the township
have so simply and naturally become the name
of the man, and the name of the man have so
simply and naturally become the name of the
city. The result would have been less happy if
the city had been fated to bear the names of not
a few of the comrades and fellow-workers of its
own <i>epônymos</i>. The name of the Bernician village
and of the man who bore it is at least more in place
than the names of some other spots in the same
land, spots condemned to bear the name of a Greek
island or a Greek poet, of an Egyptian city or
a Roman oligarch. The federal capital of the
younger England bears a name more truly English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
than the kingly capital of the elder. London is
a name which has no meaning save in a tongue
other than our own; it is the badge of our conquest
over another race. Washington is a name in our
own tongue, a badge, not of conquest but of fellowship.
And the man whose birth one hundred and
fifty-four years back is this day kept as a high day
by no small part of the English folk, should be
honoured, and is honoured, by every branch of the
English folk alike. It is in no small measure
his work and the work of them that wrought
with him, that the speech and law which one
age of English settlement bore from the European
mainland to the European island, which another
age of English settlement bore from the European
island to the vaster mainland of America, are
the speech and law of millions of men in either
hemisphere, of more millions of men than are
numbered by any other branch of the common
European family.</p>

<p>There may be ears in which the title which I
have chosen for my panegyric speech of this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
may perchance sound strange. I speak of Washington
as the Expander of England. The Expansion
of England is a form of words which of late
we have often heard, and to some of those on
whose lips that form is most familiar it may
indeed seem strange to hear the first President
of the United States claimed as the foremost in
the work of that expansion. Yet some, I trust,
there may be who will at once see that among the
worthies of our people there is none on whom
that name can more truly be bestowed. The
place of Washington in the history of mankind,
more truly the place of a band of men of whom
Washington was but the foremost, is one which
is well-nigh without a fellow. It is not the place
of the founders, real or mythical, of cities and
realms in earlier or later days. It is not the place
of the men who fenced in the hill by the Ilissos
to become the home of the teachers of mankind
or the hill by the Tiber to become the home of
their rulers. A city bears the name of Washington,
but Washington was not its founder; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
mighty land calls him the Father of his Country,
but, like him who first bore that name, he was
not the creator of its freedom but the preserver.
His place is not the place of the men who won
new homes for their folk in other lands, the men
who carried the life of Hellas to the Naxos of
Sicily or the life of England to the Ebbsfleet of
Kent. Men like them had gone before him; his
work needed theirs as its forerunner; Virginia,
Massachusetts, and their fellows, needed to be
called into being before he should come whose
calling was to weld them into one greater whole.
Nor was his place wholly that of the men who
have won the freedom of their own or of some
other land from tyrants from within or from
oppressors from without. Most like him among
the men of old in pure and unselfish virtue is
he, great alike in war and peace, who freed
alike the mother and the daughter, the man who
freed both his own land and her greatest colony.
Yet the work of Washington is not the same as
the work of Timoleôn either at Corinth or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Syracuse. One stage of the work of Washington
was done in arms; yet he is not wholly like the
men who in other days have won the freedom of
nations on the battle-field. His work was not
wholly like the work of the men who wrought
the freedom of Jewry in defiance of the will and
mandate of Asia, or of the men who wrought the
freedom of Greece and Servia in defiance of the
will and mandate of Europe. One stage of his
work was done in peace, but it was not wholly
like the work of the great reformers of other
times, of Kleisthenês, of Licinius, or of Simon.
More like was it to the work of a man most
unlike himself, the man of wile and diplomacy
who brought freedom like a thief in the night
into Sikyôn and Corinth. More like was it to
the work of the men of sturdy and enduring
might who won victories for freedom on the field
of Morgarten or among the dykes of Holland
and Zealand. And yet the founder of
the greatest of confederations holds a place not
quite the same as that of the founders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
lesser confederations of other times. William of
Orange called a free people into fuller being by
breaking the yoke of a stranger far away who
called himself their sovereign. So Washington
called a free people into fuller being by breaking
the yoke of a sovereign far away; but then that
sovereign was not a stranger. Markos of Keryneia
and Aratos of Sikyôn, and those whom the
stern truth of history bids us call the nameless
men who wrought the freedom of the Three Lands,
had to deal with nearer enemies. They had to
deal with enemies who were in some sort strangers,
but who were still men of their own speech at their
own doors. Washington and his fellows had in
one sense to form a nation, in another sense to
free a nation; they had to win the freedom of
their own special land by breaking the yoke of
the common chief of their whole people. They
had to make the whole greater by rending away a
part; they had to be the expanders of England, to
enlarge the bounds of the folk of England; but
they had to do it by breaking old ties asunder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
by casting an old allegiance to the winds; they
had, in short, to work the Expansion of England
by working the dismemberment of the British
Empire.</p>

<p>Herein comes the great truth, the seeming
contradiction, which is embodied in the life and
work of the worthy of this day and of the men
who were his fellow-workers. There may, I trust,
be still some left, who can take in the thought
that there may be true brotherhood among men
of the same race and speech, though their homes
may be physically parted by the full breadth of
Ocean, though they may be parted into distinct
political communities, possibly rivals, possibly, by
some unlucky chance, even enemies. Let us go
back&mdash;there is no parallel so living&mdash;to those old
Greek analogies of which I have often spoken,
the analogies which some of us may still
have in our memories. Let us place ourselves
in the plain of Altis on one of those high
festivals when the scattered folk of Hellas come
together as speakers of the common tongue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Hellas, as worshippers of the common gods of
Hellas. They come from every scattered settlement
of Hellenic speech from the pillars of
Hêraklês to the altar of the Tauric Artemis. The
race is run; the victor is proclaimed, the victor
whose success is to give fresh glory to his native
city, the city which on his return he may not
enter, like other men, through the opened gate,
but through the breached wall, as it were the
conqueror of his own birth-place. That city may
be one of the renowned centres of the Greek
motherland; it may be Athens or Sparta, Thebes
or Argos; but it may also be the Iberian Zakynthos
or the Campanian Kymê, Kyrênê on her
terrace by the Libyan sea or far away Olbia by
the banks of Dnieper. Every scattered member
of the great brotherhood comes there of equal right;
all are alike at home in the gathering of the united
folk; all throng to the common hearth of the
common gods of Hellas and her children. From
east and west and north and south, all are alike
Hellênes; none would refuse the name; none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
would endure to have the name refused to him.
Wherever men of Hellas have planted themselves
on barbarian soil, the soil has become Hellas
through their presence. The man who goes forth
from Athens to Milêtos still remains Greek and
Ionian; the man who goes forth from Rhodes to
Gela still remains Greek and Dorian. The tie of
national brotherhood, the abiding feeling of the
oneness of the folk, lives on through physical
distance, through political separation, through
political rivalry and wasting war. Here is indeed
a gathering of scattered kinsfolk, but it is no
gathering of dependencies round a common mistress
or even round a common mother. It is
the picture of something nobler; the picture of
scattered communities, free and equal, gathered
together in a common home and rejoicing in the
tie of common brotherhood.</p>

<p>Let us try to call up the like picture of another
scattered folk, a folk which has spread itself
far and wide over the islands and continents of
Ocean, as the folk of Hellas spread itself over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the islands and continents of the inner sea. The
settlements of the men of English blood and speech
in our own day are in many things a lively image
of the settlements of Hellenic blood and speech
in the elder day. It is indeed hard to conceive
a spot round which the whole English folk might
gather as the whole Hellenic folk gathered around
the altar of the Delphian Apollôn or the Olympian
Zeus. But let us conceive such a gathering in
some venerable spot of the mother-land, in its
temporal capital or in its ecclesiastical metropolis.
Let us conceive the scattered brethren meeting
from their distant homes, from America, Australia,
Africa, from every land where English enterprise
has found a new dwelling-place for the speech
and the law of England. But could the scattered
men of England meet together on the same terms
on which the scattered men of Hellas met together?
Let us stop for a moment to think of the terms
on which it seems to be commonly taken for
granted that they must meet together if they
meet at all. I have just been reading some brand-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>new
rimes, the literal translation of which might
be toilsome, but the general drift of which it is
not hard to see. We hear in the patriotic poet’s
strain of</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“The great England over seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where, giant-like, our race renews<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Puts on once more its manhood’s thews.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Yet more mysteriously is the fervent hope set
forth</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In what the promised Elysium is to consist is
a little dark, but it is plain that its blessings
are to be confined to “the peoples of our Queen,”
and that, whatever may be the exact political condition
described as being “in bondage free,” it is
reached only by those who are members of “one
undivided Empire.” A question which I put on
another occasion is now answered. Till this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
doctrine was thus clearly laid down, I was
allowed to hope that “the great England over
seas” at least took in that mighty company of
free and independent commonwealths, speaking
the English tongue, living under the English
law, where, whether “in strenuous ease” or
otherwise, our race has surely renewed its
strength on the shores once planted by the
Thirteen Colonies of England, and in the wider
lands to the west of them. It is now at last
plain that, in this new-fledged patriotism which
can see national union only in “undivided Empire,”
no place is found for the country of the man
whose birth and deeds we this day remember.
It is plain that “the great England beyond seas”
is one in which Virginia and Massachusetts, Illinois
and California, have no part or lot. Strange indeed
to those earlier colonists, to the man of Hellas and
to the man of Canaan, would the doctrine have
sounded that there could be no national fellowship
save among “peoples” of the same sovereign, that
national brotherhood could take no shape but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
of “undivided Empire.” “Empire” forsooth; there
is something strange, nay something ominous, in
the way in which that word and its even more
threatening adjective seem ready to spring to every
lip at every moment. The word sounds grand and
vague; grand, it may be, because of its vagueness.
To those who strive that every word they utter
shall have a meaning, it calls up mighty and
thrilling memories of a state of things which has
passed away for ever. Its associations are far from
being wholly evil. It calls up indeed pictures of the
whole civilized world bowing down to one master
at one centre. But it calls up thoughts of princes
who bound the nations together by the tie of a just
and equal law; it calls up thoughts of princes who
gathered the nations round them to do the work of
their day in that Eternal Question which needs no
reopening because no diplomacy has ever closed it,
the question between light and darkness, between
West and East. But the thought of Empire is in
all shapes the thought, not of brotherhood but of
subjection; the word implies a master who commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and subjects who obey; “Imperium et
Libertas” are names either of which forbids the
presence of the other. The thought of “Empire,”
alike in its noblest and its basest forms,
may call up thoughts of nations severed in blood
and speech, brought together, for good or evil,
at the bidding of a common master; it cannot
call up the higher thought of men of the same
nation, scattered over distant lands, brought
together, not at the bidding of a master, but at
the call of brotherhood, as members of a household
still one however scattered. In the gatherings
of the Hellenic folk around the altars of the gods
of Hellas the thought of Empire was unknown.
Still less could the thought of Empire cross the
mind when Carthage, in the pride of her wide
dominion, still sent the offerings of a child to her
mother Tyre in her Persian bondage. If Empire
there was, if we must so cruelly thrust the special
Roman name either backwards or forwards, if
Athens had her tributaries, if Carthage had her
subject lands, the thought of Empire was cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
aside when the higher thought of brotherhood
was called to life. When the just judge from
Aitôlia, representative of the mother-land in its
Eleian settlement, bestowed the Olympic wreath
on the Olympic victor, he asked not whether
the city from which that victor came did or did
not follow the lead of any mightier city in war
and peace. Athens, keeper of the hoard of Dêlos,
had there no precedence over the smallest town
whose tribute helped to fill her coffers. When
the scattered brethren came together on their day
of union, the only master whom they knew was
one who sat on a higher throne than the thrones
of Babylon and Susa; the one Imperial lord whom
united Hellas knew was he whose graven form
sat in his majesty in the temple round which
they gathered; their only king was the deathless
king of Olympos, the common Father of gods
and men.</p>

<p>That this now familiar name of “Empire” expresses
a fact, and a mighty fact, none can doubt.
The only doubt that can be raised is whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the fact of Empire is a wholesome one, whether
it is exactly the side of the position of our island
in the world which we should specially pick
out as the thing whereof to boast ourselves.
Empire is dominion; it implies subjects; the
name may even suggest unwilling subjects.
From one point of view the analogy which the
word first suggests, the analogy with the first
state that bore the name, with the ruling commonwealth
of Rome, is perfect. The People of
Rome were, in constitutional theory, lords and
masters of their subject lands, those provinces
which they held as <i>folkland</i> on a mighty scale,
the estates to which the ruling people was not
only a corporate sovereign but a corporate landlord.
And so the People of Great Britain, if not in
constitutional theory, yet in forms of daily speech
which express the facts more truly than any
constitutional theory, proclaims itself as the corporate
ruler, perhaps the corporate landlord, of
no small portion of the world. If I may quote
a phrase which I have myself used in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
place, the “corporate Emperor We,” that manifold
Imperial being of which you and I and all of
us rejoice to be members, ranks high indeed
among the potentates of the earth. No phrase
comes more readily to the lips of the patriotic
Briton than that of “our Indian Empire;”
and he speaks truly. For “ours” it is; we
instinctively call it so; for “we,” through the
Parliaments and Ministries which exist only by
“our” choice, can legislate and administer for
millions on millions of human beings, our subjects,
our provincials, who have no voice in determining
their own destiny, but who must humbly accept
their doom from us. “We” hold India, “we”
govern India; “we” sometimes, in our Imperial
clemency, stoop to say that we govern it, not in our
own interests but in the interest of those over whom
we rule. We are minded, in short, in dealing with
our provinces and with their subject inhabitants, to
be an Emperor after the pattern of Hadrian, not
an Emperor after the pattern of Constantius. But
this is not our only Empire. We have too&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>the
most familiar phrases daily repeat the form&mdash;a
Colonial Empire. The instinctive phrase is
true, true to the very letter. We&mdash;the same
We that have an Indian Empire, have also a
Colonial Empire. For an Empire it is. With
reference to them also, I must again insist on the
fact sometimes forgotten, that the freest of British
colonies, those who can act with most unshackled
freedom in their internal dealings, are not like the
colonies of old Hellas or of older Canaan; they are
still dependencies, provinces, subject lands, which
have not escaped the absolute dominion of the
corporate Emperor. That they can do ought for
themselves is wholly of our grace and favour; they
hold their practical independence as our gift, the
gift of their corporate master. But, more than this,
fact will sometimes over-ride theory even still
nearer home. In theory every part of this United
Kingdom has equal rights; there are no provinces,
no subject lands; there is no favoured city or district
whose inhabitants have any claim to bear
themselves as the masters of any other. Yet truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
will out; the corporate Emperor will assert himself
in defiance of such pleasing theories. No man says,
“We” must govern England, or Scotland, or Wales,
or any part of England, Scotland, or Wales; but
we every day hear the phrases, “We must govern
Ireland,” “we” must do this and that for Ireland,
while we should be amazed indeed if the people
of Ireland, any more than the people of India,
should take upon themselves to say back again,
“We must govern England.” Nay, I have seen
the full doctrine of Empire, the doctrine which
makes the corporate Emperor, not only ruler but
landlord in his provinces, set forth in the clearest
words with regard to one part of what we still
formally hold to be an United Kingdom with equal
rights in every part of it. Not long ago I read
something very instructive on this head in that
one among English newspapers which we may
be always sure says what its conductors really
think, and not what it is for the moment convenient
for party purposes to say. I there read
of Ireland as an island which, if “we” had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
governed, “we” had at least owned, for six
hundred years. There are points in this saying
on which it might be well to consult both a lawyer
and a chronologer; but the doctrine of “Empire,”
the doctrine that the people of one part of the
United Kingdom are master and landlord over
another part of the United Kingdom, could hardly
be set forth more clearly.</p>

<p>The fact of Empire then cannot be denied. The
burthens of Empire, the responsibilities of Empire,
cannot be denied. They are burthens and responsibilities
which we have taken on ourselves, and
which it is far easier to take on ourselves than
to get rid of. The only question is whether this
our Imperial position is one on which we need
at all pride ourselves, one about which it is wise
to be ever blowing our trumpet and calling on
all the nations of the world to come and admire
us. Is there not a more excellent way, a way
which, even if it is too late to follow it, we
may at least mourn that we have not followed?
Is it wholly hopeless, with this strange, yet true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
cry of “Empire” daily dinned into our ears,
to rise to the thoughts of the old Greek and the
old Phœnician, the thought of an union of scattered
kinsfolk bound together by a nobler tie than
that of being subjects of one Empire or “peoples”
of one sovereign? Will not the memories of this
day lift us above this confused babble about a
British Empire patched up out of men of every
race and speech under the sun, to the higher
thought of the brotherhood of the English folk,
the one English folk in all its homes? Surely
the burthen of barbaric Empire is at most something
that we may school ourselves to endure;
the tie of English brotherhood is something that
we may rejoice to strive after. Cannot our old
Hellenic memories teach us that that brotherhood
need be none the less near, none the less endearing,
between communities whose political
connexion has been severed&mdash;alas, we may cry,
that ever needed severing? The land in which
Washington was born has not yet wholly forgotten
the name of the “old dominion.” Might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
it not have been better if the word “dominion,”
dominion on the part of the mother-land, had
remained as unheard on the shores of English
Virginia as it was on the shores of Hellenic
Sicily? I have elsewhere traced in full the
historic causes which led the colonists of
modern Europe to plant only dependencies, provinces,
of the lands from which they severally
set forth, while the colonists of Phœnicia and
Hellas planted free and independent cities.
It is easy to trace the causes; it is yet
easier to trace the results. Those results are
written in the whole history of the Western
hemisphere from the river of Saint Lawrence to
the river of La Plata. It is written in the fact
that, while in the colonies of the elder world
the men who were most honoured were their
founders, in the colonies of the younger world
the men who are most honoured are their deliverers.
Whom do we honour this day? Not
a man who went forth from the mother-land to
plant a settlement, but a man who helped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
tear away the long planted settlement from the
dominion of the mother-land. For the career of
Washington, for the career of Bolivar, there was
no room among the colonies of Ionia or the
colonies of Sicily. Between them and their
parents in the elder Hellas, there was no bitter
remembrance of a time of parting, a time of
parting in anger and in bloodshed. It would
seem as if the colonial history of later times
had picked out Korkyra and Kamarina as the
model colonies of the elder time. I have said
that among the worthies of old time the one
whose fame is most akin to the worthy of our
day is the deliverer of Syracuse, Timoleôn of
Corinth. But that we describe him as Timoleôn
of Corinth at once goes to the root of the matter.
That we have to speak of Timoleôn of Corinth,
while we can hardly speak of Washington of
England or of Bolivar of Spain, brings out in its
fullest life the difference between the colonial
systems of the elder and the younger Europe. The
deliverer of Syracuse was a man of Corinth, a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
whom the mother-land sent forth to free her
daughter alike from domestic tyrants and from
foreign enemies. The deliverer of Virginia and
her sisters was a man of Virginia, a man who
had once played his part against the foreign
enemies of the English name, but whose abiding
glory was won by parting asunder the newer
lands of England from the elder. I shrink from
saying that he had to fight against tyrants or
enemies&mdash;let us strive to veil the grievous fact
under some gentler words&mdash;but so far as he
had to deal with tyrants or with enemies, they
were tyrants and enemies to be looked for in
the mother-land. Timoleôn had to strive against
strangers and hirelings, against Carthage and the
motley hosts which she sent against Hellenic Sicily.
Washington had to strive against strangers and
hirelings, but they were strangers and hirelings
whom the elder England sent to work the subjection
of the younger. Timoleôn had to break
no tie of allegiance; in freeing the daughter
city he was carrying out the bidding of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
mother. Washington had to trample allegiance
under foot; he had to become, in legal form, a
rebel and a traitor; he had to free the daughter-land
in defiance of the bidding of the mother-land
and their common sovereign. In short,
his work, the work of his fellows, was to work
the dismemberment of the British Empire. But
in working the dismemberment of the British
Empire, they wrought, I say once more, the true
Expansion of England, the enlargement of the
bounds of the English folk, and of all that the
English bears with it to all its newly settled
homes.</p>

<p>We have come back again to our paradox.
What is the “Expansion of England?” Do
the words mean simply the expansion of the
dominion of England, or do they mean the expansion
of England itself? Is it the expansion of
England when Englishmen go forth to other lands,
among men of other tongues, to toil, to strive, to
rule, but not to dwell? The dominion of England
may be expanded when men found a counting-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>house,
a barrack, an office of government, a court of
judgement, and when they have done their work in
one of these, come back to enjoy their wealth or
their honours in the land of their birth, the land
which they mean to be the resting-place of their
bones, the dwelling-place of their children. It
is surely the expansion of England only when
a new land is won for the English folk as an
abiding-place for ever. When men go forth to
found, not merely a seat of wealth or a seat of
power, but a home where they may live and die,
where they may leave their graves and leave their
children to guard them, then is England itself
expanded. So it was in Kent; so it was in Virginia;
so it is at this day on countless shores and
islands beyond the Ocean. There is no expansion
of a land and its folk in the mere winning of
barbaric dominion, or even in holding kindred
or neighbouring nations under a rule which they
love not. England is not expanded either by
keeping “our” dominion over the Green Island
that lies beside us to the West or by extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
“our” dominion over the Golden Chersonêsos far
to the East. Do not mistake me; to annex, to
coerce, to hold in bondage, may, in some unhappy
state of things, be a solemn and fearful duty;
it can never be matter for rejoicing or for boasting.
But there is matter of rejoicing, so far as boasting
is lawful, there is matter for boasting, whenever
the English folk wins a new land, not merely to
rule over but to dwell in, a new land in which the
speech, the laws, the traditions of England may
be as much at home as they are here in this our
England in Britain. What is England? The
old Teutonic name speaks for itself; it is the
land of the English, the land of the English
wherever they may dwell. Wherever the men
of England settle, there springs to life a new
England. There was a day when Massachusetts
was not England; there was an earlier day when
Kent itself was not England. The elder and
the younger land, the land beyond the sea and the
land beyond the Ocean, have been made England
by the same process. Men went forth from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
first England to found a second, and from the
second England to found a third. In our onward
march we passed from the European mainland to
the European island and from the European island
to the American mainland. In each case there
was a making of England, an expansion of
England; John Smith on the shore of Virginia
did but go on with the work which Hengest had
begun on the shore of Kent. In each case the
newer England became the greater; men crossed
the sea to found a greater England than the
first, and they crossed the Ocean to found a
greater England than the second. In each case
they expanded England; but they did not in
both cases expand the dominion of England.
At Ebbsfleet, the Naxos of Britain, men founded
a new England in Britain as independent of the
older England on the mainland as the new
Hellas in Sicily was independent of the older
Hellas by the Ægæan. With the second voyage
it was not so; the third England beyond the
Ocean did not arise free and independent; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
needed an after-work, an after-work never
needed in the second, to make it so. And that
work was surely an expansion, an expansion of
England. We come once more to our paradox;
may it not be that England herself may be expanded
by the very cutting short of her dominion?
Again, what is England? Do we mean by it
simply the dominions of the Crown of England&mdash;or
rather the dominion of a Crown of whose
kingdom the British England is but a part? Or
do we mean by it the land of the English folk,
wherever they may dwell? Is there any contradiction
in holding that the land of the English
folk may be made greater, greater in mere
physical extension, greater too in all that makes
a folk and an English folk, by changes which
cut short the mere dominion of the English Crown,
which, in other words, work the dismemberment
of the British Empire? May not the œcumenical
England, the whole congregation of English
people dispersed throughout the world, become
greater, as the mere dominion of part of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the dominion of this second England, this insular
England, this British England, becomes narrower?
Are we to be told that men of English blood, of
English speech, of English law, ceased to be English,
because they ceased to be under the rule of the
sovereign of the British England? Once more
back again to our ancient memories. Call up once
more a man of Carthage; ask him if he ceased to
be Phœnician, if he threw away the memory and
the fellowship of the Phœnician name, because, in
his new home on the shore of Africa, he owed
reverence only and not allegiance to the mother-city
on the shore of Syria? Call up once more a
man of Syracuse&mdash;I will not say one who helped
on one moonlight night to thrust down the Ionian
invader from the steeps of Epipolai or who
plied his oar for the Dorian city in the last
fight in the Great Harbour&mdash;throw a veil over
the strife of Greek with Greek, as we will throw
a veil over the day of shame when men from
the second England wrought a barbarian’s havoc
on the rising council-house of the third,&mdash;let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
rather say, call up one who, on the day of
Salamis, helped in a work no less than that of
Salamis by the side of Gelôn at Himera, call up one
who struck the last blow for freedom and Hellenic
life amid the breached walls and burning houses
of Selinous, one who marched forth with the
deliverer from the mother-land to win the
wreath of Hellenic victory by the banks of
Krimisos&mdash;ask such an one if he was less a Greek,
if he had less share in the name and brotherhood
of Greece, because his city between the two
Sicilian havens was a commonwealth as free and
independent as the elder city between the two
Peloponnesian gulfs? True, the man of Carthage,
the man of Syracuse, had, unlike the man of
Virginia or Massachusetts, no yoke of the motherland
to cast aside; but surely the man of Virginia
or Massachusetts was, if anything, less English
when he knew dependence, when he had to obey
the decrees of an assembly in whose choice he had
no part, than he became when he rose to the full
age and stature of an Englishman by winning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
those full rights of freedom which Carthage and
Syracuse had from the beginning. We have
so strangely passed away from the political
conceptions of earlier ages, that the word <i>colony</i>
is held to imply dependence. In the old Thirteen
lands of America we hear of the colonial period
as meaning the time of imperfect freedom; when
full freedom is won, the name of colony is cast
away. And yet surely a colony of England was
not meant to be a mere Roman <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">colonia</i>, a mere
Athenian <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κληρουχία</span>, a garrison to hold down a
subject province; it was surely meant to be, like a
Greek <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ἀποικία</span>, a new home of English life and
English speech. In that nobler sense of the word,
a colony which is not independent has not risen
to the full rank of a colony; it is hardly a home
for the new folk of the mother-land; it is little
more than an outpost of its dominion. Surely
the Englishmen of those Thirteen lands, who had
unhappily to fight their way to the full rights of
Englishmen, did not cease to be Englishmen, to be
colonists of England, because they won them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Surely&mdash;I have said it already and I may have
to say it again&mdash;they became in a higher and
truer sense colonies of the English folk because
they had ceased to be dependencies of the British
Crown.</p>

<p>I speak of Thirteen lands; and thirteen is as
it were a magic number in the history of federations.
It is a memorable number alike in the
League of Achaia and in the Old League of High
Germany. But in none of the three was Thirteen
to be the fated stint and bound among the sharers
in the common freedom. Thirteen stars, thirteen
stripes, were wrought on the banner of the United
States of America in their first day of independence,
the day of their second birth as truly and
fully a second English nation. Look at that
banner now; tell the number of those stars and
call them by their names, each of them the name
of a free commonwealth of the English folk. See
we not there the expansion of England in its
greatest form? See we not there the work of
Hengest and Cerdic carried out on a scale on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
which it could never have been carried out in
the island which they won for us? The dependent
provinces of England stretched but in name
to the banks of the Father of Waters; from the
border ridge of Alleghany, as from the height of
Pisgah, they did but take a glance at the wider
land beyond. The independent colonies of England
have found those bounds too strait for them.
They have gone on and taken possession; they
have carried the common speech and the common
law, beyond the mountains, beyond the rivers,
beyond the vaster mountains, beyond the Eastern
Ocean itself, till America marches upon Asia.
Such has been the might of independence; such
has been the strength of a folk which drew a
new life from the axe which did not hew it down,
but by a health-giving stroke parted it asunder.
It may be, it is only in human nature that so it
should be, that the fact that independence was
won by the sword drew forth a keener life, a
more conscious energy, a firmer and fiercer purpose
to grow and to march on. The growth of a land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
free from the beginning might perchance have
been slower; let it be so; a slight check on the
forward march would not have been dearly purchased
by unbroken friendship between parent
and child from the beginning.</p>

<p>It is a strange feeling which comes over us as
we stand by the southern bank of the Ohio, as
we look over the wide stream which once parted
French and English lands, as we look from what
once was dependent England into what once was
dependent France. And as there we muse, we think
of the earlier work of the worthy of to-day. We
think of the share that he had in changing so
large a part of dependent France into what was
still for a while to be dependent England. Other
names from either side of Ocean press on us as
we trace out that old border-land and think upon
its history. I found something to muse upon
where amid the smoke of Pittsburg the name still
dwells of a chief worthy of my own land and of my
own college. But his name comes first who was
to play his part in a twofold expansion of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
who was first to help in the mere enlargement
of her dominion, and then to be foremost in
the mightier work of enlarging her very self
by snapping the dominion of one part of the
English folk over another. Washington, fighting
for one King George, did well; Washington,
fighting against another King George, did better.
Look again at Washington’s own land, and see
how healthy is the process of dismemberment to
a free commonwealth. Look at Virginia, mother
of Presidents, mother of States, the Megalopolis
of a new Achaia, worthy of a place even beside
the city of Philopoimên and Polybios. If we hold
that England is expanded by the dismemberment
of her dominion, the old dominion of England
was expanded by the dismemberment of herself.
The land of the English folk is enlarged as free
Virginia throws off free Kentucky, as the Thirteen
stars admit a fourteenth member of the constellation.
In that starry firmament there is no lost
Pleiad; even the Lone Star needed not long to shine
in loneliness. The man of this day and his fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
lighted a candle which cannot be put out, a candle
which is ever handing on its flame to lesser lights
which may one day be the greater. And in the
wider view of the English folk, in the wider view
of England, it was in truth in and for England
that they lighted it.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>On this twenty-second day of February I have
said but little, I have time left to say but little,
of the man by whose birth that day was made
memorable. I cannot speak now of the modest
virtues of one on whom greatness was indeed
thrust, a greatness which consisted, not in the
brilliancy of fitful genius, not in the growth of
any one gift so as to overshadow and overwhelm
others not less needful; but in the equal balance
of all, the unswerving honesty, the native dignity,
which enabled him to play a worthy part on so
many stages, to act wisely and righteously in
any post to which the chances of a chequered
life might call him. Still less have I time this
day to speak of his fellows, of the memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
band of which he was but the foremost, on one
of the many sides of his life perhaps hardly the
foremost. When we speak of George Washington
and his work, the kindred work of Alexander
Hamilton must never be forgotten. Shall I, in
the course of my office here, ever reach those
times? Or shall I keep to my old familiar
ground of Sikyôn and Megalopolis, knowing well
that there is one among us who can deal better
than I can with the federal history of Schwyz
and Zürich, that there is another among us who
can deal better than I can with the federal history
of Pennsylvania and Rhode Island? Be this as
it may, we deal this time, this twenty-second of
February, with an idea rather than with a man.
We look at the man in his work. And we would
hold up his work as a model. There are other lands
in which his work may again be done, and done
more peacefully. No new Bunker Hill, no Saratoga,
no Yorktown, would be needed to call into
being other independent Englands as free and
mighty as either the elder or the younger. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
continents beside Europe and America have become
homes of the English folk, and the homes
of the English folk in those other lands may not
always lag behind the great home of the English
folk between the Oceans. The tale of “the
English in America” is now in telling, in most
worthy telling, here among us. Some other pens
in times to come may write the tale of “the
English in Australia,” of “the English in Africa,”
and they may have to trace the story after the
same pattern. Let Federation grow and prosper,
so long as no contradictory adjective is tacked
on to a substantive so worthy of all honour.
Where there is Empire, there is no brotherhood;
where there is brotherhood, there is no Empire.
I shall hardly see the day; but some of you
may see it, when the work of Washington and
Hamilton may be wrought again without slash
or blow, when, alongside of the Kingdom of Great
Britain and the United States of America, the
United States of Australia, the United States of
South Africa, the United States of New Zealand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
may stand forth as independent homes of Englishmen,
bound to one another by the common tie
of brotherhood, and bound by loyal reverence,
and by no meaner bond, to the common parent
of all.</p>

<span class="subhead">IMPERIAL FEDERATION.</span></h2>

<p>We have heard a great deal of late about
“Imperial Federation.” And the votaries of
“Imperial Federation” promise us very wonderful
things if the scheme for which they are striving
should ever become more than a scheme. Some
of the more enthusiastic talkers have told us of
the coming union on equal terms of all the English
people&mdash;it has sometimes even been put, of all
the English-speaking people&mdash;all over the world.
We are not distinctly told whether those who
are not English-speaking people are to be shut
out from the benefits of the scheme. But the
scheme is spoken of as being something specially
and intensely English, unless indeed the word
“British” is liked better. It is not wonderful
that such promises have won over many minds.
“Imperial Federation” has a grand sound; it has
an air as if it meant something. And if it did
mean what it is said to mean, the union, on closer
and more brotherly terms, of all men of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
descent or of all speakers of the English tongue,
it would mean something to the carrying out of
which all of us would surely be ready to lend
a helping hand. There are however some little
points to be thought of on the other side. First,
there is the name; then there is the thing. It
may be some objection to the name that it is
altogether meaningless, or rather that it is a
contradiction in terms. It may be some objection
to the thing that, whether the results of the
scheme should turn out to be good or bad, they
could never be the particular results which its
votaries, at least its more enthusiastic votaries,
tell us that they are aiming at. What is meant
might seem to be the closer and more equal
political union of all, or a part, of the dominions
of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. Now
that, whether good or bad, possible or impossible,
in itself, would be a very different thing from
an union of all English-speaking people&mdash;and, we
must suppose, of none other. It tells a little
against the name of the scheme that what is
“Imperial” cannot be “Federal,” and that what
is “Federal” cannot be “Imperial.” It tells a
little against its substance that none can expect
the scheme to carry out its professed purpose except
those who have forgotten the existence of
India and the existence of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
The simple truth is that the phrase “Imperial
Federation” is a contradiction in terms, that what is
imperial cannot be federal, and that what is federal
cannot be imperial. To make out this proposition
we must look a little more closely into the history
of the words concerned. One of them at least
seems to have greatly changed its meaning of late
years, and it would be well to know the exact
sense in which it is used.</p>

<p>The word “imperial” is the adjective of the
substantive “empire.” Now what is meant by
“empire”? Speaking as a “pedant,” I cannot
help saying that clearness of thought would have
greatly gained if the word <i>Empire</i> had always
been sternly confined to what was its strict meaning
for ages. It would have been well if the name
had never been applied to anything but the Roman
Empire and those powers which professed to continue
the Roman Empire. Or, if it ever went
beyond that limit, it would have been well if it
had been used only when it was wished to assert
an analogy between one of those powers and some
other. In this last way it is true and instructive
to speak of the Mogul Empire in India, which
supplies so many points of analogy with the
Empire of Rome; but, after the vague way in
which the word is used now, such an application
of it would fail to strike many minds as having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
any special meaning. The word “empire” in
truth has taken to itself a quite new use within
a very few years past. At no time that I know
of would any one have scrupled to speak, in
poetical or rhetorical language, of “the British
empire,” “this great empire,” and the like. But
I can remember the time when no one would
have used those phrases, except in language more
or less poetical or rhetorical. That is to say,
though the speaker may not have consciously
thought of suggesting any analogy with the Roman
Empire, yet the traditions of the time when
those words could not have been used without
implying such an analogy had still left their
stamp on language. “Empire” was a word somewhat
out of the common; it would not have
been found in the dry language of an advertisement
or in such notices as in those days answered
to a telegram. Now the word is used without
any special feeling. It seems to have taken its
place quite naturally as the highest term in an
ascending scale. As the county is greater than
the parish, and the kingdom greater than the
county, so the empire is greater than the kingdom.
The word “empire” is used as one that comes
as naturally to the lips as “parish,” “county,”
or “kingdom.” This change of language doubtless
comes of a change of facts, or at any rate of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
change in the way of looking at facts. But it
is none the less an abuse of language, and one
that has led to not a few confusions.</p>

<p>When Sir James Mackintosh, in his speech on
behalf of Peltier, spoke of Napoleon Buonaparte,
First Consul of the French Republic, as “master
of the mightiest empire that the civilized world
ever saw,” it was a rhetorical flourish, and it
may be that the thought of Rome was not
wholly absent from the speaker’s mind. When,
a little later, Napoleon Buonaparte himself bestowed
the title of “empire” on his dominions,
by no means as a flourish, but as a formal
title and a title full of meaning, the thought
of Rome was assuredly fully present to his
mind. The use of the phrase “British Empire,”
as a technical phrase from which all memory
of Rome has passed away, is a good deal later
than the use of the phrase “French Empire”
as a technical phrase from which all memory of
Rome had certainly not passed away. In one
use indeed the “Empire of Britain” and other
phrases of the like kind are very old indeed.
They are common in the tenth and eleventh
centuries, and they come in again in the sixteenth.
They are rare between the eleventh century and
the sixteenth, and they go out of use after the
sixteenth. That is to say, they were used when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
there was a reason for using them, and they went
out of use when there was no longer a reason.
In the earlier period they were meant to assert
two things; that the English King was superior
lord over all the other princes of Britain, and
that the continental Emperor was not superior
lord over him. In the sixteenth century, when,
under Charles the Fifth, the continental Empire
was again threatening, Henry the Eighth found
it needful again to assert with no small emphasis
that “the Kingdom of England is an Empire.”
I made this remark long ago; it has been
set forth with increased force and with fresh
proofs in the recent work of Mr. Friedmann.
In the seventeenth century, when the continental
Emperors were no longer threatening, and when
the common King of England and Scotland had
no need to assert any lordship over himself, such
language naturally went out of use, or sank to
the level of an occasional survival or an occasional
flourish.</p>

<p>From the newest use of the word “empire” and
the still newer use of the adjective “imperial,”
all memories of this kind have passed away. It
is hard to say whether the phrase “Imperial Parliament”
was the last use in the old sense or
the first use in the new. I suspect that it is
not in strictness either the one or the other. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
was meant to express the union of three kingdoms
into a greater whole; but it was certainly
not a protest against any continental empire; nor
did it carry with it all the meaning which the
word “imperial” has lately taken to itself. And
this use of the word is singularly isolated. It is
not applied to anything else in the same formal
<span class="locked">way<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>; nor is it our custom to apply any adjective
in the same way. On the continent adjectives
like “Imperial,” “Royal,” “Grand-ducal,” are
employed at every moment. The post-office, the
police-office, anything else that has to do with
any branch of public administration, has the
<i>K.</i>, the <i>K.&nbsp;K.</i>, the <i>R.</i>, the <i>I.&nbsp;R.</i> or anything
else of the kind, prominently put forward. We
do not write up “Royal Post-office,” though we
may mark it with the more personal badge of
V.&nbsp;R. The reason may be that on the continent
we have sometimes to ask whether it is empire,
kingdom, or grand-duchy that we are in. Here
no man ever doubted about being in the Kingdom
of England, the Kingdom of Great Britain, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
But there is no reason to think that the phrase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
“Imperial Parliament,” when it was first used,
meant anything more than “Parliament of England,
Scotland, and Ireland.” That that Parliament
could legislate for any part of the dominions
of the King of Great Britain and Ireland no man
doubted; but it is not likely that anything beyond
Great Britain and Ireland was consciously in the
minds of those who devised the title. It is only
in quite late times, in times within my own
memory, that the word “empire” has come into
common use as a set term for something beyond
the kingdom. It is only in times later still that
the adjective “imperial” has come into common
use, in such phrases as “imperial interests,” “imperial
purposes.” At the beginning of the present
century those phrases would certainly not have
been used as <i>quasi</i>-technical terms, though something
like them might at any time have been used
as a rhetorical figure.</p>

<p>In the present use of the words there is always
a latent ambiguity. What is the Empire? The
whole of the Queen’s dominions, some one will
answer, as distinguished from the mere Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland. But in what sense
is this an Empire? The word is clearly not used
in the old sense anywhere but in India. To the
title of “Empress of India” there were good objections
on other grounds; but it cannot be denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
that it accurately expresses the nature of the
Queen’s power in India. The Empress of India is
Lady over dependent princes and nations in India,
just as the “totius Britanniæ Basileus” once was
lord over dependent princes and nations in Britain.
But this sense does not in the same way apply to
the Queen’s dominions in America and Australia;
it hardly applies to her dominions in Africa. In
what sense do these last form parts of an empire?
Is the word meant to imply or to deny any superiority
on the part of the seat of empire, that is,
on the part of the Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland? Or is it, by that odd confusion of thought
and language which is by no means uncommon,
meant somehow to imply that there is such a
superiority, but that such superiority ought to
exist no longer? As long as the word was a
mere figure or flourish, designed simply as a vague
name for a great extent of territory, it was needless
to ask its strict meaning; it had no strict
meaning, and could not mislead anybody. But
now that it has become a technical term, we have
a right to ask its strict meaning. It adds to the
difficulty that we are dealing with an Empire
without an Emperor. The Queen is not Empress
anywhere but in India; the title may not even
be used in the United Kingdom. Otherwise the
natural meaning of the phrase “imperial interests”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
would seem to be the interests of the Emperor, as
opposed to any other. It would mean the interests
of the imperial power, as opposed to the
interests of the states which are dependent on the
imperial power. The word as now used seems
intended to mean the interests of the whole of
the Queen’s dominions, as opposed to the interests
of any particular part of them. But this is an
odd use of the word “imperial.” We should never
speak of “royal interests,” to mean the interests
of the whole kingdom, as distinguished from the
interests of any particular part of it. “Royal
interests,” if the words had any meaning, would
mean the special interests of the King. “Imperial
interests” would as naturally mean the
special interests of the Emperor. Only, as there
is no Emperor, it is possible for the word to
go about and pick up for itself less obvious
meanings.</p>

<p>When then we hear of “Imperial Federation,”
we first wish to know the meaning of the word
“imperial;” next we wish to know the meaning
of the word “federation.” I once defined “a
federal government in its perfect form” as “one
which forms a single state with regard to other
nations, but which consists of many states with
regard to its internal government.” And I have
seen that definition quoted with approval by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
advocates of Imperial <span class="locked">Federation<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>. It has been
argued that a federation that answers my definition
is already formed&mdash;perhaps not by the whole of the
Queen’s dominions, but by “the United Kingdom,
the Dominion of Canada, the different Australian
colonies, New Zealand, and the Cape.” From such
a list I could not have left out the Kingdom of
Man and the Duchy of Normandy&mdash;that part of
it I mean which clave to its own dukes and remained
Norman, when the rest submitted to a
foreign king and became French. Nor are we told
whether India, Heligoland, Gibraltar, and a few
other places, are parts of the federation or not.</p>

<p>Now the singular thing is that some of those who
look upon the connexion of the United Kingdom
with the other parts of the Queen’s dominions as
being already a federal union are fully sensible of
the fact which at once shuts out the federal relation.
“The United Kingdom,” it has been well put,
“keeps to itself, and absorbs within itself, the foreign
policy of the whole realm.” The word “realm,”
commonly used as equivalent to “kingdom,” seems
here to be used as equivalent to “empire,” and the
relation here described may be fairly called Imperial.
The same fact has been put yet more strongly;</p>

not merely of the Queen, but of our Parliament&mdash;that is
of the inhabitants of the United Kingdom, or rather of
such of those inhabitants as are voters.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a rough practical sense this is true; but
that it should be true, even in a rough practical
sense, curiously illustrates the conventional nature
of our whole system. In theory the whole
foreign policy rests in the hands of the Crown.
The Queen cannot pass a law or impose a tax
without the consent of Parliament; she can
declare war or conclude a treaty without asking
Parliament about it. But, in a rough practical
way, Parliament, and through Parliament the
constituencies, can exercise a good deal of influence
on foreign policy, though an influence
much slighter and much less direct than that
which they exercise on domestic policy. But
the colonies can exercise no influence at all on
foreign affairs; therefore they are not only subjects
in the sense in which any man in a monarchy
is a “subject” of the Emperor, King, or Grand-duke;
they are subjects in the sense of being a
society of men which is subject to another society.
They are, in short, what a Greek would have called
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ὑπήκοοι</span> and a Swiss <i>Unterthanen</i>. And, large as
their actual powers of self-government are, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
are all&mdash;unlike the immemorial rights of Man and
Jersey&mdash;mere grants from the Crown or from
the Parliament of the United Kingdom itself.
And, though the exercise of the power is in some
cases just as unlikely as the exercise of the
power of the Crown to refuse assent to a bill
that has passed both Houses, still the Parliament
of the United Kingdom has never formally given
up its right to legislate for any part of the dominions
of the sovereign of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Practically however the chief British colonies
are independent as concerns the internal affairs
of each; they are practically dependent or subject
only as regards the common policy of the “realm”
or “empire.” And it has been said, and that not
by an opponent of “Imperial Federation,” that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“These two opposing principles, subordination on the
one hand, and self-government on the other&mdash;we might
almost say subjection and freedom&mdash;cannot long co-exist.
This imperfect, incomplete, one-sided federation must end
either in disintegration or incomplete and equal and perfect
federation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The only question is whether a federation thus
limited is federation at all, and not really subjection.
When we speak of “imperfect, incomplete,
one-sided federation,” the adjectives destroy the
substantive; they show that the relation spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
of is not a federal relation at all. All the elements
of a federation are wanting. There is no
voluntary union of independent states, keeping
some powers to themselves and granting other
powers to a central authority of their own
creation. There is instead a number of dependent
bodies, to which a central authority
older than themselves has been graciously pleased
to grant certain powers. This state of things
is not federation, but subjection. It is perfectly
true that an American State, as such, has
no more direct voice in the foreign affairs of
the American Union than a British colony has
in the foreign affairs of the British “empire.”
But why? The colony has no such voice, because
it is a subject community and never had a voice
in such matters. The American State has no
such voice, because the direction of foreign affairs
is one of the powers which the States have
ceded to the Federal authority. But, more than
this, not only has the colony no direct voice
in ordering foreign affairs, itself and its citizens
have no voice, direct or indirect, in choosing
those who have the ordering of them. But the
American State and its citizens have a direct
voice in choosing those who have the ordering
of the foreign affairs of the Union. The citizens
of the several States, as citizens of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
States, choose the [electors of the] President, by
whom foreign affairs are actually ordered. The
States themselves in their Legislatures choose
the Senators, by whom the acts of the President
are approved or annulled. Here are two very
different stories; the difference between the position
of the American State and the position
of the British colony is nothing short of the
difference between federation and subjection.</p>

<p>In truth the relation between the United
Kingdom and the colonies does not answer my
old definition of federation which it has been said
to answer. The colonies are not “states” in the
sense of that definition. The “states” there
spoken of are communities like the cities of
Achaia, the cantons of Switzerland, the states
of America, sovereign and independent communities,
which, while keeping to themselves
certain of the attributes of sovereignty, have by
their own act ceded certain other of its attributes
to a central <span class="locked">authority<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>. The colonies are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
not states in this sense; instead of having granted
any powers to a central authority, they have
only such powers as the central authority chose
to grant to them. They are not states; they
are only municipalities on a great scale. I shall
doubtless be told that the colonies can alter
their criminal law, their marriage law, and a
crowd of other laws, which a municipality at
home cannot alter. But why? The colonies
can do all these things, simply because Parliament
has given them the power to do them; and
Parliament can, if it chooses, give the same
power to the Common Council of London or to
the parish vestry of Little Peddlington.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Thus far we have been dealing with a state
of things which may very likely be “imperial,”
but which is assuredly very far from “federal.”
It is a state which&mdash;we have good authority for so
saying&mdash;cannot last very long, but which must
soon be exchanged either for disintegration or
for federation. The question in truth comes to
this; Shall an “empire” break up or shall it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
be changed into a federation? To speak of
changing an imperfect federation into a perfect
one gives a false idea of the case. What is
really proposed to be done is not to change a
lax confederation into a closer one or an imperfect
confederation into a perfect one. It is to bring
in federation, as a perfectly new thing, where
at present there is no federation, but its opposite,
subjection. And it is proposed to bring in federation,
not only as a perfectly new thing, but
under circumstances utterly unlike those under
which any of the present or past confederations
of the world ever came into being. The proposal
that a ruling state&mdash;if any one chooses to call
it so, an “imperial” state&mdash;should come down
from its position of empire, and enter into terms
of equal confederation with its subject communities,
is a very remarkable proposal, and
one which has perhaps never before been made
in the history of the world. It may therefore
be well to take a glimpse at the causes which
have led to so unprecedented a proposal and to
the unprecedented dilemma of which it forms
one horn.</p>

<p>It is this subjection of the colonies to the
mother-country which is, as I have fully argued
elsewhere, the great point of difference between
modern European colonies and those colonies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
the elder world which have in other respects so
much in common with them. While the relations
between metropolis and colony are the brightest
facts of Greek or Phœnician political life, in
modern times the relations between mother-country
and colony have often been among the darkest.
The subjection of the colony is, as none see
more clearly than some advocates of Imperial
Federation, an unnatural thing, at the very
least a thing which becomes unnatural as soon
as the colony has outgrown its childhood.
Then comes the alternative, “disintegration”
or federation. That is, Shall the colonies part
from the mother-country and become independent,
or shall they remain united to the
mother-country on some terms other than those
of subjection? In the Greek system the alternative
could not occur; where the colony
was independent from the beginning, there was
no room for “disintegration.” And though we
are sure that the mother-country, taught by experience,
would not now think of trying to keep
by force any colony that wished to separate,
yet “disintegration” is a process which is perhaps
not to be desired in itself. It must be better
either never to have been united or never to
separate. The separation may be needful, but it
must be something of an unpleasant wrench. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Greek system made it needless. Metropolis and
colony were all the better friends because the
relation of subjection had never existed between
them.</p>

<p>But it is the other alternative of federation
which we have now to discuss. Is that alternative,
the substitution of federation for empire,
possible? Let us at least remember that what
is proposed is unlike anything that ever happened
in the world before. That certainly does not of
itself prove that the proposed scheme is either
impossible or undesirable; still it is a fact worth
bearing in mind. It is always dangerous to
imagine a precedent where there is none. A
perfectly new scheme should stand forth as a
perfectly new scheme, as something which may
commend itself by its abstract merits, but which
has nothing in the way of experience to recommend
it. And such is the scheme of federation
between the mother-country and the colonies.
No ruling state has ever admitted its subject
states into a federal <span class="locked">relation<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>. Ruling states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
have often admitted subject states to equal
privileges with themselves; but the promotion
has taken the shape, not of federation but of
absorption; that is, subjects were raised to the
rank of citizens. Of this Rome is the great
example; her citizenship was gradually extended,
first to the Italian allies&mdash;fruit of their war of
independence&mdash;and then by slow degrees to the
provinces also. Now the people of our colonies
need no admission to citizenship. They are
already British subjects; the essence of the
modern colonial relation is that they remain
British subjects. The inhabitants of the colonies,
each man by himself, are the equals of
the inhabitants of the United Kingdom; this or
that colonist may be an elector in the United
Kingdom; let him come and live in the United
Kingdom and he may become a member of Parliament,
a cabinet minister, a peer of the realm.
It is only the communities, as communities, that
are subject. Now it would be quite possible to
unite the mother-country and the colonies in a
way that might be called at pleasure the removal
of subjection or its aggravation. They might be
united as Rome and her Italian allies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
united, as Scotland, and Ireland were united to
England. They might send members to the
Parliament of the United Kingdom in fair proportion
to their numbers. They would then have
exactly the same control over the general affairs of
the kingdom, “realm,” “empire,” whatever it is to
be called, which the inhabitants of the United
Kingdom have now. And, considering the
geography of the case, it may be that, instead
of Westminster, some point, some island perhaps,
more central for the whole “empire” might
be chosen as the place of assembly. But,
with such an union as this, the local Legislatures
of the colonies must be abolished. The
Parliament of the whole “empire” must legislate
for the whole “empire.” The colony, in short,
must rise or sink to the level of a county. The
soil of the colony, the people of the colony,
would receive the most perfect equality with
the soil and the people of the mother-country.
Subjection would be utterly done away with.
Canada would be no more subject than York.
But a share in the control of the affairs of the
whole empire would be bought by the loss of
all special control over the affairs of the colony
itself. Some might think that such a price
would be too dear. Self-government, the kind of
self-government which the colonies have hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
enjoyed, would come to an end. There would
be only that lesser self-government which belongs
to an English county or borough; the internal
affairs of any colony would be legislated for by
an assembly in which the members for that
colony might be outvoted. Subjection, in short,
formally abolished, would practically be made
more complete.</p>

<p>I believe that nobody proposes anything like
this. I feel sure that every colony would at
once reject such a scheme. Still such a scheme
would be the consistent carrying out of one form
of union, and that the most perfect form. But
it may be said, We wish to preserve the colonial
Parliaments, and at the same time to have members
for the colonies in the Imperial Parliament.
The question would then arise, the question
which arises also in the case of Ireland, Are the
colonial members to have votes in the affairs of
the United Kingdom? If the Parliaments of the
colonies are to remain, while members for the
colonies have votes in the Imperial Parliament
which, it is to be supposed, is still to settle the
affairs of the United Kingdom, one of two results
must come. If, while the affairs of the colonies
are discussed in their own assemblies, the affairs
of the United Kingdom are discussed in an assembly
in which the representatives of the colonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
have votes, then the mother-country will in
truth become dependent on the colonies. The
other alternative is that the dormant power of
the Imperial Parliament to legislate for the
colonies, a power which has never been formally
laid aside, will be called into new being
whenever it suits the purposes of the members
for the United Kingdom. The difficulties and
confusions of such a state as this would be
endless; so would be those that would follow on
the scheme which would doubtless be proposed
as their remedy. That would be something like
this. As the colonial Parliaments settle the
affairs of the colonies, so let the Parliament of
the United Kingdom still settle the affairs of
the United Kingdom; let the colonial members
who are added to it in its “Imperial” character
vote only on “Imperial” questions, and leave
the affairs of Great Britain and Ireland to be
settled by the members for Great Britain and
Ireland. But to say nothing of the odd position
of men who would be members of Parliament
on one division and not members of Parliament
on another, how is the distinction to be drawn?
Even in a real federal constitution, where the
States surrender certain named powers to the
federal authority and keep all other powers,
questions will arise whether this or that point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
is of federal or cantonal competence. How much
more will such questions arise when it may be
asked in almost every case of legislation, Does
this matter concern the colonies or not? Would,
for instance, such a question as Irish Home Rule,
or any change in any direction in the relations
between Ireland and Great Britain, be looked
on as an “Imperial” question, or as one touching
Great Britain and Ireland <span class="locked">only<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span>? It is often hard
enough to settle rules for assemblies called into
being for the first time; but how much harder
will it be, when an assembly has had for ages
an absolutely boundless range of powers, and
where every member has always had an equal
voice on all subjects, to bring in a new class of
members who shall have votes on certain classes
of subjects only, and those classes of subjects
which it will be practically impossible to define.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But, be any scheme of this kind good or bad,
possible or impossible, it is not Federation.
We have seen elsewhere what Federation means
and how federations grow. A federal union
involves a certain loss of power and position
on the part of the states which unite to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
it. But, as federations have been formed hitherto,
that loss of power and position has either been
merely nominal or else has been fully made up
in other ways. When the Achaian cities, the Swiss
cantons, the Batavian provinces, the American
States, were threatened by enemies, whom they could
resist only by union, it was worth their while to
give up the independent power of peace and
war; for each city or state to cleave to it would
have meant for each city or state to be subdued
singly. In some of these cases many of the states
had never really exercised the independent powers
of peace and war. There was no moment when
Aargau or Indiana could have made war on its
own account; and, if we say that there was a
moment when Massachusetts or Pennsylvania
might have done so, it was only an ideal moment
which had no real historical being. In each of
the great federal unions some of the members,
in some of them all the members, distinctly
gained in political position by entering the
Union. Federation is a check on independence;
but many of the states had never known separate
independence. But it will be quite
another thing to ask a great power, a ruling
power, a mighty and ancient kingdom, which
has for ages held its place among the foremost
nations of the earth, to give up its dominion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
to give up its independence, to sink of its own
will to the level of a new State or Canton.
It will be quite another thing to ask the Parliament
of such a kingdom, a Parliament which
has for ages been a sovereign assembly, which
has for a very long time believed itself to be
the first of all assemblies, a Parliament whose
range of functions has been boundless, whose
will has known no limit save the limits which
the laws of nature impose on all wills&mdash;to
ask such a Parliament as this to come down
from its seat, to give up to some other assembly
not yet in being the widest and greatest
of its powers. In any real federation between
the United Kingdom and the colonies, the
Parliament of the United Kingdom would be
no more than the Legislature of an American
state or a Swiss canton; it would have to content
itself with those lesser powers which it
would not be called upon to surrender, with
mere local powers over the mere local affairs
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland. No voice, direct or indirect, in the
great business of the world could be allowed to
such a purely local body, any more than it is
at this moment allowed to the Legislature of
Bern or of New York. We must look things
in the face, and this is what we have to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
in the face. Perhaps not one man in a thousand
who has chattered about “Imperial Federation”
has ever stopped to think what “federation”
means, any more than he has stopped to think
what “empire” means. Most likely he means
something quite different from the picture which
has just been drawn. Most likely he thinks that
Great Britain and the Parliament of Great
Britain will somehow become greater by becoming
parts of an “Imperial Federation.” All this confusion
comes of using words without thinking of
their meaning. If by “federation” is meant
some wholly new device, something the like of
which is not to be found either in the existing
world or in any past age of the world, we can
better discuss the merits of the new device if it
is called by some new name of its own, rather
than if it uses old names like “empire” and
“federation” in some strange sense. But if by
federation is meant a known political system, a
system which has existed in the past and which
does exist in the present, if is meant such a
constitution as once was in Achaia and Lykia,
as actually is in Switzerland and America, then
we may undoubtedly answer that such a demand
was never yet made on any ruling people or any
ruling assembly, and that the Parliament and
people of Great Britain will assuredly not be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
first to set the world the example of accepting it.
Every man of us will feel his back set up if we
are asked that the Houses of Lords and Commons
shall become the Senate and House of Representatives,
not of “Greater Britain,” which might
haply be promotion, but of a mere canton of
Greater Britain, a canton keeping for its Legislature
powers somewhat larger, it may be, than
those of a Town Council or a Court of Quarter
Sessions, but powers as essentially local and
secondary in their nature. This or that American
or Australian colony may be naturally glad to
meet the mother-country half-way; but will the
mother-country be equally glad to go and meet
them? To rise to the political level of Bern
and New York in the existing <span class="locked">world<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>, of Megalopolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
and Xanthos in a past world, would be
undoubted promotion for Victoria or New Zealand.
It would hardly be promotion for Great
Britain, for England or Scotland, or for Wales
either, to sink to that political level.</p>

<p>Now some votaries of the federal scheme seem
to see all this, which its more enthusiastic partisans
seem not to have thought of. Such disputants do
not argue for the perfect form of Federation, the
<i>Bundesstaat</i>, the constitution of Achaia as it was,
of Switzerland and America as they are. They
would have us fall back on something more like
the mere <i>Staatenbund</i>, the type of imperfect
Federation which the Seven United Provinces
never threw off, but which Switzerland, after a
long experience, and the United States after a
short one, did throw off in favour of those more
perfect forms of Federation which they at present
possess. It does not perhaps quite settle the
question to say that this would be indeed a step
backwards. It might be argued, at least as a
specimen of ingenuity in disputation, that such
a lax kind of union might possibly suit a confederation
whose members lie at vast distances
from one another, though it has been proved not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
to suit confederations whose members lie close
together. And then one might argue back again
that the physical disunion needed of itself to be,
as far as might be, counterbalanced by the closest
political union. In a mere <i>Staatenbund</i> all
difficulties about the relations of the British
Parliament to the new Federal Parliament would
be got rid of; for there would be no need of any
Federal Parliament. But either the union would
have to be so lax as to be really no confederation
at all, or else, even in this less perfect union, the
British Parliament would still have to give up
some of its chiefest and most cherished powers.
Instead of a Federal Assembly, there would be
a mere <span class="locked">congress<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> or conference of representatives
from each member of the Union, a congress meeting
to discuss the foreign affairs of the Union,
perhaps with power to settle them, perhaps not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
At present the foreign affairs of the kingdom, and
of the “empire” too, are settled by the advisers of
the Crown, subject to the indirect control of the
British Parliament. And in a perfect federation,
a <i>Bundesstaat</i>, this indirect system might go on,
the indirect control being of course transferred
from the British Parliament to the Parliament of
the whole “empire.” But in a mere <i>Staatenbund</i>
it is hard to see how an indirect control can be
brought to bear upon anybody. If the Congress
is to have authority to decide in foreign affairs,
it must consist of representatives of the several
members of the Union. Only then where would
be the authority of the Crown and the responsibility
of the ministers of the Crown? And with
the authority of the Crown, the authority of
Parliament, of all the Parliaments, will have
vanished also. The only way of giving them, or
leaving them, any authority, would be the helpless
plan of making the congress merely consultative.
It might be a body which should simply recommend
measures, and leave them to be approved
and carried out by the Legislatures and Executives
of the several States, or possibly of some majority
of them. This is in theory a possible form of
union; but it is not exactly the form most likely
to lead to speedy and energetic action, if a confederation
scattered over every corner of the globe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
should be called on to strike a sudden blow for
its political being.</p>

<p>In short, if the <i>Bundesstaat</i> is out of the
question, the <i>Staatenbund</i> is yet more out of the
question. The <i>Bundesstaat</i> is a form of constitution
which has worked well in those cases where it has
suited the circumstances of the time and place in
which it has been introduced. Only it is not
suited to the circumstances of Great Britain and
her colonies, and it is not likely to work well
among them. But it is not too much to say that
the <i>Staatenbund</i> has never yet really worked
well under any circumstances, and that it is
certainly not likely to work well for the first
time when applied to circumstances yet more
unfavourable than any under which it has hitherto
been tried.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But these are not the only difficulties about
Imperial Federation. To whom is the federation
to extend? To all the subjects of the Queen
of Great Britain and Ireland? Or only to such
of them as are European by dwelling-place or
descent? Or, to come nearer to the point, we might
put the question thus; Is it to take in only the
subjects of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland,
or the subjects of the Empress of India as well?
This is a subject of some importance, about which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
it will be well clearly to know our own meaning.
As yet, the doctrine of Imperial Federation is
somewhat vague, and its objects are somewhat
fluctuating. Sometimes we are told that the Imperial
Federation is to be an union of all English-speaking
people. The wiser advocates of the
scheme see the difficulties, but they seem for the
nonce to put them in their pockets. They do not
talk either of a federation of all English-speaking
people or of a federation of all the Queen’s
dominions. They mention those parts of the
Queen’s dominions, those parts of the English-speaking
people, to which they wish their scheme
of federation to extend, and they say nothing
about any other parts of either. But this is
not to go to the root of the matter, and it
is humdrum work compared with the talk
of the more enthusiastic votaries of “Imperial
Federation.” It is to be the “federation of the
Empire,” that is presumably of the whole “Empire;”
and in some of the highest flights it would
sometimes seem as if the “federation of the
Empire,” and the “federation of all English-speaking
people” were the same thing. Now
about this last there are some other difficulties, of
which we may say somewhat presently; at this
stage the difficulty is that such a rule would not
only shut out a few speakers of European tongues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
nearer home, it would not only shut out those
uncivilized natives of colonial possessions who
often save us all trouble by dying out before us,
but it would further shut out the vast native
population of India, a part of the subjects of the
common sovereign of Great Britain and India
who must be thought of one way or another. If
we are to have a real federation of the Empire,
the whole people of the Empire must be let in
with full federal rights, as political equals of the
Englishman of Britain and the Englishman of
Australia. But this would be something very
different from a federation of the English-speaking
people. Such an enfranchisement as this
would indeed be a leap in the dark, a leap such as
no people ever took before. It is not for us to
say what would be likely to come of it; let us
rather ask those who talk about Imperial
Federation whether they have thought what
would be likely to come of it. Whenever the
thing is to talk big about “empire,” its greatness,
its “prestige,” all about the dominion on which
the sun never sets, all about the drum-roll of the
British army going the round of the world, then
India is the dearest, the most cherished, the
sublimest, part of the talk. “Imperial” interests,
“imperial” greatness, “imperial” everything,
seem specially at home in that land. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
specially imperial soil. “Our Eastern Empire,”
“our Indian Empire,” is the grandest subject of all
for magnificent eloquence. And why? To speak
the plain truth, because here the corporate Emperor
“We” comes in on the grandest scale. “We” govern
India; “we” hold the dominion of Aurungzebe;
is not every British elector part of a great corporate
Aurungzebe? But receive India to federation,
and “we” cease to do all this. In a federation
of the “Empire,” “we” must simply sink into the
position of citizens of one or more of its states;
the elector for London will be in no way privileged
above the elector for Masulipatam. It may even
be that the “we” shall be turned about, and that
people at Masulipatam will begin to say how
“we” govern England. Instead of every British
elector being part of a corporate Aurungzebe,
it may be that every Indian elector shall be part
of a corporate William. Imperial Federation may
take a shape in which England, Scotland, Canada,
Australia, shall be dependencies of the Empire
of India. For truly it will need some very
artificial arrangement to secure even proportional
representation for any of those small and
distant cantons, lying so far away from the
main centre of power and population. We must
expect that in the Federal Assembly, “we,” even
strengthened by “our” reinforcements from other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
English-speaking lands, will be defeated on every
division by that vast majority of the people of the
Empire who are not English-speaking. “Our”
Imperial position will be, in truth, handed over to
quite another “we,” a “we” of whom the old
British and Jingo “we” will form a very small
part indeed.</p>

<p>I shall of course be told that nothing of this
kind is meant. And no doubt nothing of this
kind is meant by anybody. Only, if so, people
should not use words which mean either this
or nothing. They should tell us distinctly what
they do mean. The words “Imperial Federation,”
“Federation of the Empire,” either mean nothing,
or they mean that on all “imperial” questions
the speakers of English shall be liable to be outvoted
by the speakers of Tamul and Telugu.
A federation which does not give these last
equal federal rights with their European fellow-subjects
is not a “Federation of the Empire,”
but only of a small part of the “Empire.”
Such a federation would be, as regards India,
simply an enlargement of the dominant “we,” an
admission of more members to “we”-ship and
its privileges. The people of India have now for
their masters the people of the United Kingdom
only. They would then have for their masters
the people of the United Kingdom and those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the British colonies also. Such an outcome might
be highly imperial, but it would not be at all
federal, at least not federal for the vast majority
of the inhabitants of the Federal Empire. There
would be a grand stroke indeed on behalf of
“imperium,” but very little indeed would be done
on behalf of “libertas.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In truth, in this particular argument, India, so
present to every mind in every other argument,
India, the choicest flower of the Empire, the
brightest jewel in the Imperial Crown&mdash;any other
figure of speech that may spring of the oriental
richness of an imperial fancy&mdash;seems suddenly to
be forgotten. But another land seems also to
be forgotten, a land which should surely be more
to us than all the wonders of the East, a land
whose kindred and friendship should surely be
more precious to Englishmen than all the glories
and all the treasures of a hundred thousand Great
Moguls. If it would be a strange Federation of
the Empire which should shut out the greater part
of the inhabitants of the Empire, it would be a yet
stranger Federation of the English-speaking people
which should shut out the greater part of the
English-speaking people. It is wonderful to see
how the declaimers about “Greater Britain” and
“Imperial Federation” seem ever and anon perplexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
by the fact that there is on the western
shore of Ocean, perhaps not a greater Britain, but
assuredly a newer England. I believe that no one
proposes that the Federation of the English-speaking
people shall take in the United States of America;
if any one does so propose, I honour him as being
at once bolder and more logical than his brethren.
But unless such a federation does take in the
United States of America, it will assuredly be
a very lame and imperfect federation. It is the
most curious illustration of the modern theory of
colonization, the substitution of mere personal
allegiance for nationality in the higher sense, that
any mind could take in for a moment the thought
of a federation of the English-speaking people of
which the United States should not form a part.
In the ideas of too many on both sides of Ocean,
the fact that the people of the United States
are not subjects of the sovereign of the elder
England hinders them from being looked at as
Englishmen at all. The English of the United
States have indeed something to get over. The
memories of the War of Independence, the more
grievous memories of the war of 1813, have made
a sad gap between the two great branches of the
same folk between whom, if only modern Europe
had colonized on the wise principles of older
times, there need never have been any gap at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
all. That our independent colonies&mdash;I use the
name as a name of the highest honour&mdash;will
ever join with us in a political federation is
a thing hardly to be thought of. I have often
dreamed that something like the Greek <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">συμπολιτεία</span>,
a power in the citizens of each country
of taking up the citizenship of the other at
pleasure, might not be beyond hope; but I have
never ventured even to dream of more than that. It
is our bad luck at present that there are only two
independent English nations, two English nations
which parted in anger, and neither of which has
quite got over the unpleasant circumstances of
the parting. As long as there are only two
such English nations, there is almost sure to
be somewhat of jealousy, somewhat of rivalry,
between the two. And there will always be on
both sides people who take a strange pleasure in
stirring up ill-feeling among kinsfolk. Surely, if
there were three or four or five independent
English nations, there would no longer be the
same direct rivalry between any two of those
nations; there would be far more chance of
keeping up friendly feeling, more chance of
keeping up, if not the impossible federation, yet
something like an abiding political alliance, between
all the members of the scattered English
folk. The sentiment is possibly unpatriotic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
but I cannot help looking on such a lasting
friendly union of the English and English-speaking
folk as an immeasurably higher object
than the maintenance of any so-called British
empire. I may judge wrongly; but it strikes
me that the establishment of a rival federation, an
“imperial” federation, is not the best way to keep
up such a friendly union. A single federation,
especially a federation which would be an immediate
neighbour, would be likely to call out more
active jealousies in the United States than are at
present called out by the single kingdom and its
dependencies. Towards several independent English
nations, whatever might be the political
constitution of each, feelings of this kind would
be likely to be far less strong. We are told
that, if we will not have Imperial Federation, we
must have either “disintegration” or the continued
“subjection” of the still dependent colonies. It is
a question which as yet one cannot do more than
whisper; but would “disintegration” be too
dearly bought, if it carried with it the perfect
independence of the United States of Australia,
and a greater chance than we now have of keeping
the lasting good will of the United States of
America?</p>

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> This is historically true of the Achaian cities, of the
Swiss cantons (in 1848), and of the original American
States. All these really did cede certain powers and
keep others. Of the American States admitted since
the acceptance of the Federal Constitution by all the
original States, it is not historically true, but it is true
by a legal fiction. Massachusetts really ceded certain
powers to the Union. Missouri never did, as a historical
fact; but it did so by a legal fiction when it was admitted
to the same rights and the same obligations as
Massachusetts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The second union of Greek cities under the headship
of Athens comes nearest to such a change; but it is not
a real precedent. The cities which formed the second
Athenian alliance had once been subjects of Athens; but,
when the second alliance was formed, they were subjects
of Athens no longer; they entered the union as independent
states. And the union was not really a federation,
but only a close alliance. Moreover, before very
long, Athens was at war with her own allies.</p></div>

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> When I wrote this a year ago, I did not foresee that
the question of Home Rule would become an immediately

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> I am speaking here of political position, not of political
power, still less of extent of territory or population.
Bern is small, New York is great; but the political position
of the two is the same; each is the greatest member
of an equal confederation. And that political position
is higher than that of any British colony, even though
the Legislature of the colony may actually have, as in
some cases it has, greater powers than the Legislature
of the American State or Swiss canton. For the greater
powers of the colony are mere grants from a higher
authority; they are bestowed by royal charter or by Act
of Parliament. But the smaller powers of the American
State or Swiss canton are the inherent powers of an
independent state. They are those powers which an
independent state kept to itself and did not cede to the
federal authority.</p></div>

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> The use of the word <i>Congress</i> for the Federal Assembly
of the United States is a curious instance of the
survival of a word when the thing expressed by it has
wholly changed its nature. Up to 1789 the United
States had a body which had naturally borrowed the
name of <i>Congress</i> from the diplomatic gatherings with
which it had much in common. In 1789 this mere
Congress gave way to a real Federal Parliament. But
the Federal Parliament kept the name of the imperfect
institution which it supplanted.</p></div></div>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
